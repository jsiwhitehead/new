      "As will by now be all too apparent, the Five Year Plan’s final year has brought challenges different to those of the preceding four. The world is caught in the grip of a fast‑spreading virus that has claimed many thousands of lives and severely disrupted a large share of humanity’s social and economic activity. Yet the Bahá’í community has remained composed and has acted swiftly to meet the immediate demands that confronted it. It has found ways to ensure the continuity of community life, while also striving to play its part in meeting spiritual and material needs in society more widely—a fitting response to an emergency situation. We commend all the action that has been taken so far. Now, however, we wish to explore more fully what the coming year might entail. Your efforts to stimulate the advancement of the Plan in its final months will inevitably be shaped by your pressing responsibility to guide the friends in their response to an evolving global crisis. These unique circumstances require that we address you directly; you may share this letter with your communities, in whole or in part, as you deem appropriate.",
      "When we expressed our desire to see five thousand intensive programmes of growth established by the end of this Five Year Plan, we were keenly aware of the magnitude of the undertaking this implied, but the condition of the world demanded it. We called for the work of strengthening programmes of growth to accelerate everywhere. We were gratified to see how the supporters of the Cause were galvanised into action, exerting unprecedented levels of effort. In the space of four years the Bahá’í community doubled both the number of core activities occurring worldwide and the number of their participants. To have brought hundreds of thousands of individuals into the embrace of the community’s activities in such a short period is an advance in capacity that has no parallel in any of the previous Plans in the present series.",
      "Much, then, has been accomplished, and this is a clear indicator of the strength and confidence of the Bahá’í community. But, as you already appreciate, the current crisis has altered the context in which the Plan is being pursued. We have been impressed by how many communities have taken great strides in adapting to this new reality. Far from viewing the present period as simply a hiatus to be endured with patience, they have recognised that the state of the world has made the need to render meaningful service to humanity more urgent. Naturally, the activities undertaken must suit the prevailing conditions, but there should be no doubt that this is a time for noble aims, high resolve, and intense endeavour. As is well known, the activities of the Plan are intended to cultivate a thriving community spirit, through which resilience to mighty challenges is also strengthened. Educational efforts aim to raise up a growing number of souls who can contribute to the spiritual and material well‑being of a community; devotional meetings nurture the spirit of service as it blossoms, rooting it in a culture of collective worship. In short, the promotion of the Plan implies building capacity to walk the path of service in every time and season—which must surely include moments of acute peril in the life of humanity, such as now. It is essential, then, that the steps being taken to learn how to apply the Plan’s framework for action to the current circumstances of the world continue in earnest; in all likelihood, the global health crisis will have a direct impact on Bahá’í activities, to a greater or lesser degree, for months or even years, and the task of adapting to the situation cannot be postponed. In this regard, the Continental Counsellors and their auxiliaries, ably guided by the International Teaching Centre, have shown impressive determination in their efforts to spur on the friends and orient them in their approach to the work at hand; they will doubtless do the same over the coming four cycles and beyond.",
      "We appreciate, of course, that some activities have had to be suspended, and particular strategies or methods that are unsuited to current conditions have had to be set aside for a time. However, while certain possibilities have been temporarily closed, others have opened up, and new means have emerged for strengthening existing patterns of activity. Flexibility has proven to be an asset, but so has vigilance in ensuring that the primarily local character of community activities is not diluted; efforts to nurture flourishing communities within neighbourhoods and villages and across clusters must continue. In some cases, present conditions have created unexpected opportunities for widening community participation in devotional meetings and study circles, conducted with safety in mind. Many parents whose families have been confined to home surroundings have welcomed support that has helped them to move from the position of observer to protagonist in the spiritual education of their children. Junior youth and groups of youth have discovered the power of simple acts of compassionate service carried out with wisdom. Nevertheless, it would be understandable if you determine, in some instances, that plans that require the movement of pioneers, mobile tutors, or visiting teachers will have to be postponed, and this should not give you cause for concern; you can reevaluate the situation in the months ahead. The coming One Year Plan could afford an opportunity to fulfil any goals or objectives that may in the end remain out of reach during the present Plan.",
      "We recognise that continuing to function in the course of this crisis will, in many cases, put you under financial strain, and the economic hardship being experienced by many in the community may limit the resources upon which you can draw. Be assured that we stand ready to support you. Let there be no doubt or equivocation in this regard: it is essential that the institutions of the Faith maintain their operations throughout this period and not be obstructed by lack of resources in the discharge of their core duties. Unquestionably, the whole company of the faithful in each country will rally around you, and in particular, we are confident that believers with means will come forward to aid you.",
      "As you are aware, there is considerable unevenness in the ways that different societies are coping with the difficulties arising from this crisis; consequently, the challenges that confront different National Assemblies are not the same. And these challenges will change over time. This will call for tremendous agility as local, regional, and national institutions seek to read their reality and stay alert to new developments. We wish to impress upon you that your collaboration with the Counsellors will be of paramount importance: it should be committed and sustained, an almost constant exchange of information and insight, to ensure that you are responding swiftly to the needs of your community, anticipating problems before they emerge, seizing opportunities that open up, and supporting promising initiatives. Exactly what measures should be taken by Bahá’í institutions will naturally depend on the relevant circumstances. But in every place, the friends will need clear and timely guidance; special attention must be given to those who are most at risk from the virus itself, or from the economic impact of its spread; and creative approaches will be required to sustain the collective spirit of the community during difficult times. Networks of various kinds comprising families, neighbouring households, or other groupings are offering valuable support to many; you should be confident in the resourcefulness of your communities, and seek to draw on their talents and energies to the fullest. As grave as conditions have already become in some places, National Assemblies in countries that have so far been spared the more severe consequences of the pandemic must keep in mind that there is the potential for worse to occur, and any preparations that can be made now for that eventuality, before the introduction of further restrictions hampers such efforts, should commence at once—without alarm, but without delay. Local Spiritual Assemblies in particular should consider what means might be within their power to prevent, relieve, or mitigate suffering in the wider society of which they are an integral part.",
      "When society is in such difficulty and distress, the responsibility of the Bahá’ís to make a constructive contribution to human affairs becomes more pronounced. This is a moment when distinct but interrelated lines of action converge upon a single point, when the call to service rings aloud. The individual, the community, and the institutions of the Faith—inseparable protagonists in the advancement of civilisation—are in a position to demonstrate the distinctive features of the Bahá’í way of life, characterised by increased maturity in the discharge of their responsibilities and in their relationships with each other. They are summoned to a fuller expression of the Faith’s society‑building powers. Agencies and projects dedicated to social action may have to adapt their approaches in order to meet expanded needs; efforts to do this are sure to infuse ongoing programmes with deeper meaning and purpose. Further, Bahá’í contributions to discourses newly prevalent in society are generating heightened interest, and there is a responsibility to be discharged here too. At a time when the urgency of attaining higher levels of unity, founded on the incontestable truth of humanity’s oneness, is becoming apparent to larger and larger numbers, society stands in need of clear voices that can articulate the spiritual principles that underlie such an aspiration.",
      "You are of course ever conscious that your responsibilities reach beyond those of administering the affairs of the community and channelling its energies towards the fulfilment of noble goals: you seek to raise awareness of those spiritual forces that are available to every confirmed believer and which must be marshalled at the hour of need. It is these forces which endow the community with resilience, ensure its integrity, and keep it focused on its divine mission to serve humanity and elevate its vision of the future.",
      "It is not possible to foresee the extent to which this pandemic will influence the movement towards unity among the nations. But there is no doubt whatsoever that, for the endeavours of the Bahá’í community, the months ahead will be consequential. Indeed, it could hardly be otherwise. This final year, of the final Plan, in a series spanning the final quarter of the opening century of the Formative Age, will seal the foundation upon which will rest the next series of global undertakings. It is the concluding act in a captivating drama whose end is yet unwritten.",
      "Not a moment passes when you are not in our thoughts. All our trust and confidence in your capacity to face this challenge comes from our knowledge that your ultimate supporter and helper is the Abhá Beauty Himself. In our entreaties at the Sacred Threshold, we implore Him to make you pure channels for the flow of His grace to humankind.",

      "In November, the Universal House of Justice had the opportunity to consult with the International Teaching Centre and the Counsellors serving North America. From these consultations, as well as other recent occasions when the progress of growth in your nation has been reviewed, the House of Justice noted with pleasure the concentration of energies directed by your institution to the progress of the Five Year Plan. You have worked diligently and effectively, in close collaboration with the Counsellors, to consolidate the changes brought about by the reorganisation of your regions in 2012. Attention has been given to guiding Regional Bahá’í Councils, establishing programmes of growth in every goal cluster, and supporting the work of learning sites and the associated institute coordinators in nearly doubling the size and reach of the junior youth spiritual empowerment programme. Steps have been taken to enhance involvement in the life of society at the level of thought and action. Beginning with the successful youth conferences held last year, your community, like many others, has demonstrated an ability to reach out to young people, Bahá’ís and others, raising their vision and stimulating their desire to contribute to the betterment of society, particularly by attending to the needs of those younger than themselves. And most recently, there has been renewed focus on engaging simultaneously in multiple lines of action and ensuring coherence as you do so. Work in each of these areas will, no doubt, be wisely and systematically extended as the measures you have put into place to build capacity for learning from the cluster to the national level gradually bear fruit. This must include reinvigorating aspects of the Plan that may have waned to some extent, such as the dynamism of the regional institutes, the engagement of the generality of the friends in a cluster in the pattern of community building, and the efforts of Area Teaching Committees to maintain the rhythm of three‑month cycles of activity. In this regard, a few comments are offered for your consideration.",
      "A steady flow of individuals through the sequence of courses is required if the training institute is to prepare the human resources necessary to respond to the demands of the process of growth at ever‑higher levels of complexity. The first stage in the development of the institute process in your country drew largely upon the participation of veteran believers. Another considerable advance came when, following the regional conferences in 2008 at the midpoint of the last Plan, there was a marked upsurge in the involvement of the believers and their friends in the institute process. And whilst it is clear that the programmes of the institute will continue to be offered to anyone, what is equally clear is that your community is now poised for a major turning point as you labour to realise the potential for the movement of thousands of young people through the sequence of courses. When buttressed by the wholehearted support of the community, such a movement would not only lend impetus to the advancement of clusters throughout the United States, but this focus on working with so significant a number of youth will also naturally shape the next phase of the development of training institutes in your country. An effective approach to attracting young people has already been demonstrated, first at the conferences and subsequently in local gatherings. Attention can now be directed to learning how to translate their initial interest into systematic and well‑integrated involvement in community‑building endeavours in a cluster. Among the questions to be addressed are how to deepen conversations and expand bonds of friendship within groups of youth, how to foster and sustain acts of service, how to teach those who demonstrate interest in the Faith, and how to combine the activities of the youth within the larger pattern of cluster activities. Central to this inquiry is to learn how to assist as many young people as possible to study the sequence of courses in order to raise their capacity and broaden the scope of their action. Efforts must be redoubled, then, to strengthen regional institutes—enhancing the functioning of their boards, their regional and subregional arrangements, their cluster coordinators, and their tutors. By learning how to raise up and accompany even a few dedicated and effective tutors in each cluster, institutes can provide for the capacity that is required for the movement of a sizeable number of individuals through the sequence of courses each year. The national gathering for regional coordinators in November appears to have contributed significantly to unity of thought toward advancing these aims.",
      "The capacity to reach young people and assist them in carrying out acts of service, especially for establishing junior youth groups and children’s classes in neighbourhoods that have become centres of intense activity, offers great promise for the progress of clusters at every juncture along their path of development. However, experience has demonstrated that the process of community building falters if there is a sense that the work of the Plan is confined to the young or to certain neighbourhoods alone. The House of Justice has emphasised the importance of a two‑pronged approach to expansion and consolidation, involving endeavours throughout the localities in a cluster as well as in one or more receptive neighbourhoods. The full pattern of activity envisioned for a thriving community requires involvement of the generality of believers. The friends everywhere can be assisted to overcome dichotomies, to grasp the intent of the Plan’s community‑building activities, and to determine the place each will choose in contributing to the collective effort.",
      "The participation of greater numbers of individuals in the activities of a cluster requires a strong Area Teaching Committee. Regional Councils should be assisted to learn systematically how these committees emerge organically, as a programme of growth intensifies, and contribute to the advancement of a cluster, cycle after cycle. The mobilisation of individuals to ensure steady progress of the programme of growth is the principal focus of the Area Teaching Committee. It fosters the process of reflection and planning by organising the reflection meeting, facilitating a sound reading of the cluster’s reality, and arranging for the accurate gathering and careful analysis of its statistics—all of which expand vision, build unity of thought, and illuminate the path for the progress of the cluster. Just as the training institute works closely to guide and accompany the friends who initiate children’s classes, junior youth groups, and study circles, the Area Teaching Committee can encourage and support many individuals to carry out other acts of service, such as hosting devotional gatherings, undertaking home visits, and teaching the Faith. These are not merely activities to be multiplied but fundamental aspects of Bahá’í community life intended for all. Devotional gatherings, for example, steadily multiply to include all of the believers in a cluster as well as many of their associates. The teaching work is broad in scope, encompassing personal efforts as well as collective projects, selected neighbourhoods as well as sundry localities, chosen populations as well as chance acquaintances, firesides as well as core activities. In this manner, the participation of more and more believers in the community‑building activities of the Plan has profound implications at the level of culture. Devotional gatherings, the embryo of the local Mashriqu’l‑Adhkár, kindle the stirrings of the spirit and ignite the flame of service. Visiting one another’s homes weaves bonds of love and union. Teaching becomes a way of life.",
      "This attention to the strengthening of training institutes and Area Teaching Committees will complement the efforts already under way to accelerate the expansion of the junior youth programme. Indeed, a dynamic collaboration between the training institutes and the learning sites will disseminate practices that have proven to be effective so that the programme can take root in clusters throughout the country.",
      "In The Advent of Divine Justice, that matchless call for action to your stalwart community, Shoghi Effendi refers to the “enthusiastic eagerness” of the believers in North America “to arise and display, in the vast f eld traced for them by the pen of ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá, their capacity to play their part in the work of universal redemption proclaimed by Bahá’u’lláh” when confronted by a world “dimmed by the steadily dying‑out light of religion, heaving with the explosive forces of a blind and triumphant nationalism; scorched with the fires of pitiless persecution, whether racial or religious; deluded by the false theories and doctrines that threaten to supplant the worship of God and the sanctification of His laws; enervated by a rampant and brutal materialism; disintegrating through the corrosive influence of moral and spiritual decadence; and enmeshed in the coils of economic anarchy and strife.” The House of Justice has every confidence in the ability of your institution to reawaken this enthusiastic eagerness for service throughout your community in order to raise expansion and consolidation to unprecedented levels. It is evident that once you are able to learn to replicate the pattern of intensive action within your most advanced clusters in the hundreds of other clusters where a programme of growth has been initiated, it will be possible to engage tens, and eventually hundreds of thousands of individuals in a vibrant, meaningful, and distinctive pattern of Bahá’í community life, open to all. Be assured of the prayers of the House of Justice at the Sacred Threshold that the friends in the United States may realise this high aim in the years ahead.",

      "Further to the letter dated 31 August 2014, sent to you on behalf of the Universal House of Justice, we have been asked to convey the following additional remarks to you.",
      "In its 28 December 2010 message, addressed to the Conference of the Continental Boards of Counsellors, the House of Justice noted a number of innovations being introduced in relation to administrative arrangements in the most advanced clusters, among them the division of clusters into smaller units, the decentralisation of the reflection meeting, the assignment of assistants to institute coordinators, and the deployment in teams of experienced friends to support others in the field. Learning about the efficacy of these and other approaches, of course, continues across the globe. In April 2013, the experience that had accrued up to that point was described in the document “Insights from the Frontiers of Learning” prepared by the International Teaching Centre, and the lessons being learned will, no doubt, be further elaborated at the conclusion of the current Plan. Given the rapid changes occurring in the manner that agencies of the Faith organise their work in scores of clusters in the front ranks of the process of growth in your country, it will be useful for all institutions and agencies assisting them in this regard to consider the following points.",
      "As you know, the basic scheme of coordination when an intensive programme of growth is established in a cluster often comprises up to three institute coordinators and an Area Teaching Committee of several members, who collaborate with Auxiliary Board members. The further development of this scheme in response to growth results from the understanding obtained through an ongoing process of action, reflection, consultation, and study carried out within the framework set out by the House of Justice and the experience being gained locally and across a region. Naturally, national and regional institutions guide the efforts of the friends in this regard, drawing, as necessary, on the knowledge accumulating across the Bahá’í world that usually reaches them through their interactions with the Counsellors. They are careful, however, that any suggestions they may offer those labouring at the grass roots of the community are not conveyed as instructions, for doing so could stifle the rising capacity for learning among the local friends.",
      "It is understood that the agencies of the Faith in most of your clusters that are experiencing an acceleration in the process of expansion and consolidation have taken the step of dividing the cluster into smaller units for the purpose of administering effectively the activities of the Plan. There are, however, some clusters that cover very large geographic areas where making such divisions might lead to needless complexity. It appears that you have encouraged the friends in those cases to partition the cluster into two or more clusters, applying as much as possible the criteria established by the House of Justice in its message dated 9 January 2001. Care is required to ensure that the resulting clusters do not end up with such small populations that the opportunities for the local friends to learn about achieving large‑scale growth are severely limited.",
      "Where the activities of the Faith in a cluster are being administered in several units, the general scheme of coordination has, naturally, become more complex. It is important, however, that the friends guard against making cluster administration overly complex or hierarchical as that could reduce the efficacy of the entire scheme and inadvertently impede the flourishing of relationships among the friends that are conducive to continued progress. It might be possible, for instance, for additional coordinators or assistants to coordinators to be assigned to various parts of a cluster without effectively establishing subordinate layers of cluster administration. Further, whatever form the arrangements take, the friends assuming coordination duties would need to be assisted to enhance their capacity to effectively carry out their responsibilities and become sources of constant encouragement to others if the cluster is to continue to advance. As the House of Justice stated in its Riḍván 2010 message to the Bahá’ís of the world, “sustained quantitative gains will be contingent on qualitative progress.” This is a matter of great importance that requires institutions and agencies at the regional level to further develop their ability to formulate clear approaches and plans to help those serving at the cluster level to become increasingly adept at their work.",
      "Another related matter concerns the facilitation of activities in neighbourhoods and villages. An increase in the number of people engaged in community‑building activities at that level requires that the capacity to accompany these friends grows considerably. As may have been experienced in your community, it would be unreasonable to expect that such capacity would be built by simply assigning more and more coordinators to a cluster. It is therefore heartening that the agencies of the Faith in your most advanced clusters are learning to nurture interactions among the friends serving together whereby those more experienced in a particular act of service can support others. Whatever terms are used to refer to such experienced friends, it is better at this early stage not to consider them as constituting a new position in the scheme of coordination that requires formal appointment and official designations. To do so might introduce rigidity into a mode of operation that, to be effective, needs to remain dynamic and flexible.",
      "At the level of neighbourhoods and villages, continued attention also needs to be given to the role that Local Spiritual Assemblies are playing in supporting the efforts of the friends. Your community is blessed with many well‑established Local Assemblies. Their efforts, in collaboration with Auxiliary Board members and their assistants, to stimulate and encourage the friends serving the Faith can be further augmented. This is an area of learning that you and the Counsellors may want to explore during the remaining period of the Plan, focusing perhaps on a few clusters and a selected number of Local Assemblies. It is hoped that this might also aid you to gain some insights into how encouragement and support offered to the friends by Local Assemblies could contribute to keeping the expansion of cluster‑level structures within certain limits.",
      "One matter that seemed to be of great concern to your members during the consultations at the Bahá’í World Centre was the rising number of friends who are serving the Faith fulltime and receiving some remuneration. While any impression that individuals are to be compensated for offering service in relation to the community‑building activities of the Plan is to be avoided, the growing complexity of the coordination work in many clusters cannot be sustained solely through those who are only able to give a portion of their time. It is necessary that some friends dedicate themselves fully to such work in the cluster, but it is not realistic to expect that all of these, regardless of circumstances and the time devoted to service, would be able to do so on a purely voluntary basis. Some among them would, no doubt, require financial assistance.",
      "Such remuneration to friends serving at the cluster level is, nonetheless, essentially a short‑term arrangement. On the basis of the experience in your country, you and the Counsellors may find it helpful to determine what would, in general, constitute a reasonable period during which an individual serving in a coordination role at the cluster level may be provided with remuneration. However, when the need to offer an individual financial assistance is recognised, it might be useful for the relevant agency to have a conversation with him or her in order to ascertain legitimate needs and the period during which financial support will be necessary. While in the majority of cases such support might be given by means of a stipend, in others, alternative approaches may be employed. To decide the level of assistance, factors that could be taken into consideration include whether the person resides in a rural or urban area, is required to change residence, has a family, or intends to pursue further education. While differing circumstances of individuals may call for various approaches, it is important to ensure that there is a degree of consistency in terms of the remuneration offered. It is, of course, understandable that the institutions would be unable to offer remuneration to an individual whose needs exceed what can reasonably be met by the funds of the Faith. Further, unless circumstances make it absolutely necessary, it would be best to avoid offering remuneration to friends serving at the level of the neighbourhood or village.",
      "The House of Justice is certain that your community will continue to make a significant contribution to learning about administrative arrangements in clusters in the front ranks of the process of growth as the Bahá’í world draws closer to the conclusion of the current Plan, and it will pray in the Holy Shrines that Bahá’u’lláh may confirm your efforts.",

      "The House of Justice was sorry to hear of the continuing difficulties you are experiencing as a devoted member of the community of the Greatest Name and that the clarifications provided in the letter dated 7 November 2010 written to you on its behalf have not assisted in their resolution. It is well aware of the challenges that some of the friends in the United States are facing, which obstruct the progress of expansion and consolidation. These challenges, however, lie not in the provisions of the Plan itself but rather in misunderstandings surrounding those provisions. The House of Justice observes that, occasionally, the discussion concerning the Plan has fallen into a misleading dichotomy: that individuals should engage either in a few narrowly defined activities centred around the training institute or that they should be free to choose any initiative that they wish to undertake without regard for the requirements of the Plan. Wherever this fruitless discussion emerges, in whatever variation, the result is to reduce the enthusiasm and participation of the believers and prevent them from engaging in the process of learning that lies at the heart of the Plan—a process that will, if unitedly and persistently pursued, resolve misconceptions, promote flexibility, and shed light over time on the most effective course of action.",
      "The House of Justice hopes that you will reflect on how this type of discussion may be inadvertently influencing your own conceptions about the Plan. For example, you refer to “teaching in very prescribed ways.” However, the guidance concerning the Plan does not prescribe a particular method of teaching, nor is any method of individual teaching proscribed. You ask whether an individual is free to share views on the progress of activities, yet it should be evident that such a contribution is fundamental to the learning process, which includes study of the guidance, consultation, action, and reflection. This, of course, should be carried out in a manner that seeks to understand and effectively implement the provisions of the Plan lest insistence upon personal opinions trap the friends in interminable debate on dichotomous perspectives and inhibit their understanding and action.",
      "The essence of the series of Plans that have unfolded since 1996 is relatively simple. Individuals, communities, and institutions are called upon, within the context of a cluster, to create a programme of growth involving a vibrant, meaningful, and distinctive pattern of collective Bahá’í life, infused by the spirit of the Creative Word, and open not only to the believers but to those from the wider society. At the core of this community‑building process are certain activities—devotional gatherings, the educating of children and junior youth, and the raising up of those who can engage in acts of service—that serve as portals for the participation of ever‑increasing numbers. The four core activities are but the nucleus of an organic pattern of life that, as the number of individuals who can initiate activities multiplies, increases in complexity over time, eventually requiring coherence among a range of efforts that also includes visits to homes, social gatherings, Feast and Holy Day observances, deepenings, administration, strengthening the Fund, social action, involvement in the discourses of society, and so on. All these activities are sustained and expanded by the constant endeavours of individuals to reach out to their personal contacts as well as to receptive populations through direct teaching, both personal and collective, and engagement in meaningful conversations. The process of building growing communities is cultivated within three‑monthly cycles of planning and action, and it is supported by institutional arrangements at the local, cluster, regional, national, and international levels. In far‑flung regions of the earth, the friends in diverse countries are learning to advance the programmes of growth in their clusters, ranging from those with a few simple activities to those involving hundreds of activities with the participation of thousands of individuals in a pattern of life that is spiritual, dynamic, united, growing, and transformative in nature. The House of Justice has no doubt that the American believers—who have, over the course of nearly a century of the unfoldment of the Divine Plan, achieved a record of distinctive service—have the capacity to stand among the vanguard of this process.",
      "This does not mean, of course, that there are not currently problems in understanding the Plan or putting into place its provisions in various parts of the world, or that new challenges will not arise in the future. In the work of expansion and consolidation, as the House of Justice has repeatedly observed, mistakes will inevitably be made by the friends and new challenges will present themselves. Obstacles, when they arise, are ultimately resolved through perseverance and further experience. Fruitless debate, insistence on personal views, creating false dichotomies, or the “tendency to reduce a complex process of transformation into simplistic steps, susceptible to instruction” can be carefully avoided or wisely overcome. It is learning together that is yielding the insights necessary so that “stumbling blocks can be made stepping stones for progress.”",
      "In striving to overcome their difficulties and create new patterns of action, the friends must, whether as individuals or members of institutions, be mindful of ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá’s admonition about the importance of love and fellowship and His assurance that “it is in unity the truth will be revealed and the wrong made right.” The system that Bahá’u’lláh has brought into the world will take decades and centuries to unfold, attaining ever‑increasing levels of complexity, effectiveness, and influence. Shoghi Effendi explained that “we must trust to time, and the guidance of God’s Universal House of Justice, to obtain a clearer and fuller understanding of its provisions and implications.” He also warned that “the promised glories of the Sovereignty which the Bahá’í teachings foreshadow, can be revealed only in the fullness of time.”",
      "The history of the development of the Faith offers a useful perspective. In the first decades of the Formative Age, the friends struggled with the new concepts and practices pertaining to administration presented to them by Shoghi Effendi, who carefully guided them over the years to resolve their misconceptions and disagreements. “One of the main reasons why the Faith does not advance more rapidly is because the friends have not learned to live with, and work within the framework of the Administrative Order,” a letter written on his behalf stated. “Either they crystallise it into too set a form, or they rebel against what they feel to be a System, and do not give it sufficient support.” The challenge was to learn to work according to the guidance given, not to set it aside. Today, after more than nine decades, the Bahá’ís of the world have raised the Administrative Order and forged new relationships among individuals, communities, and institutions on the basis of the exhortations found in the authoritative texts. Much remains to be done, but there has been an obvious and tremendous advance since the first years of the Formative Age—an achievement affirmed not only by Bahá’ís themselves but by a host of outside observers, who have remarked on the unity and efficacy of Bahá’í undertakings in various local and international arenas despite the fewness of our numbers. Since 1996, the believers have, addressing challenges pertaining to the large‑scale expansion of the Faith, been called on to conduct their efforts within an evolving framework for action that is required for the current stage of the unfoldment of the Divine Plan. This includes further evolution not only in our approach to growth but also in the associated administrative arrangements, all under the guidance of the House of Justice. Once again, in relation to the current requirements, the friends must avoid the tendency to “crystallise” the guidance into “too set a form” or “rebel against what they feel to be a System” and fail to “give it sufficient support.” In response to such problems in the past, Shoghi Effendi repeatedly urged the friends to better understand the principles of Bahá’í administration and strive to implement them properly. Similarly, the House of Justice can do no more than this, encouraging the friends to better understand the concepts and provisions of the Plan and to strive to implement them effectively—for they are the basis of the progress and development of the Faith in the decades that lie ahead.",
      "The House of Justice hopes that, despite any current challenges in your area, you find joy and abundant confirmations through your wholehearted participation in the teaching field.",
      "Beyond the general points outlined here, the clarification of specific concerns you have raised is best carried out in the context of your community, and you are advised to turn to your National Spiritual Assembly.",

      "The Universal House of Justice has been pleased to note over the past several years that, in cluster after cluster in India, ever‑greater numbers of believers and their friends are participating in community‑building endeavours as they strive to advance the processes of the Five Year Plan. This, of course, requires that the institutions of the Faith arise with commensurate strength in order to support these activities and ensure that the necessary resources are made available as and when they are needed. One area where institutional capacity will need to be greatly enhanced is the collection and utilisation of statistical data, and in this regard, we have been asked to convey the following comments.",
      "As the process of expansion and consolidation progresses within a cluster, the gathering of numerical data is a natural part of the everyday activities that take place as the friends carry out their work and make plans for the next steps they will take. For instance, it is only reasonable to expect that coordinators who accompany children’s class teachers would be aware of the number of such classes and the approximate number of children attending each one. So too would be the case with other coordinators of the training institute and the members, especially the secretary, of the Area Teaching Committee. In this connection, instruments such as the Statistical Report Programme (SRP) and the Statistical Report Programme for the Training Institute (SRP Institute) have proven to be of notable help in maintaining a record of this information. At certain times during the three‑month cycle of activity, institutions and agencies serving at the cluster level would pool statistical information, by generating reports from the Statistical Report Programme, thus facilitating analysis of the overall progress made and planning for the next cycle of activities. In light of the above, it is apparent that the collection of data is the result of the organic process of growth in each cluster and constitutes only one means, albeit a critical one, for assessing the progress of the Cause and the community‑building process under way. Although the data thus collected is used primarily for the benefit of agencies at the cluster level, the Statistical Report Programme allows for it to be easily forwarded to the Regional Bahá’í Council and eventually to the National Spiritual Assembly, which may require it for its own analyses.",
      "The Regional Bahá’í Councils play a vital role in facilitating the flow of information by extending the necessary assistance and resources to agencies serving at the cluster level and by raising the capacity of those involved in the collection and utilisation of statistical data. Through such endeavours, they will also ensure that their own need for information can be readily met in a timely fashion, without having to issue urgent requests or frequent reminders.",
      "The House of Justice has noted with pleasure the close and increasing collaboration of your Assembly with the Counsellors in several areas that need the attention of both institutions. Paramount among these is helping Regional Councils attain higher levels of functioning in various aspects of their work. You are asked to analyse, together with the Counsellors, what is being learned in the field regarding the flow of information and the efficacy of the systems and mechanisms in place at the regional and cluster levels and determine what lines of action need to be pursued by each of your institutions. As you are aware, the administrative aides of the Counsellors have been interacting closely with institutions and agencies at the regional and cluster levels with regard to the gathering of information, and they could potentially make an important contribution to the efforts to raise capacity in this area of endeavour.",

      "The Eleventh International Convention, recently concluded, offered all who were present a glimpse of the promise of Bahá’u’lláh to unite the peoples of the world. More than a thousand members of one hundred and fifty‑seven National Spiritual Assemblies attended, and nearly five hundred more, including those from an additional fourteen countries, participated in the election by mail. This diverse group of women and men, a veritable cross section of humanity, evinced, in their participation in the electoral process and subsequent contributions to the Convention consultations, a spirit of sanctity and love, a unity of thought and purpose, and a consecration to the collective enterprise of applying the healing message of Bahá’u’lláh that earned our deep admiration. No doubt, the members of your National Assembly, or the Counsellors, will share with you the joyous fellowship they experienced and the insights they gained during the productive days spent in the Holy Land.",
      "You now gather in National Conventions to carry out your own sacred responsibilities in the Bahá’í Administrative Order. Foremost is the election of the members of your National Assembly, when you will choose individuals who can meet the pressing requirements of the progress of the Cause at the present stage of its development. Our letter dated 25 March 2007 was intended to strengthen the Bahá’í electoral process, and we urge you to give renewed consideration to its salient points. In the features and outcomes of this electoral process that distinguish it from contemporary practices we find not limitations, but dawning points of profound implication. The delegates, as well as the generality of the believers, uphold the purity of Bahá’í elections, scrupulously avoiding electioneering or discussion of who should or should not be a member, even when specific names are not mentioned; for not only does the Guardian prohibit reference to particular personalities, but he also states that “we should refrain from influencing the opinions of others.” Collectively, the friends strive to purge themselves of every trace of worldly tendencies—pursuit of personal ambitions, promotion of individuals, contest, and partisanship—which can corrupt and distort an election’s spiritual character. Delegates are obliged to become “intelligent, well‑informed and responsible” electors so as to “be able to make a wise choice at the election time.” They enjoy the unfettered right to choose from among all those eligible, whether it be to retain members or to select new ones. The community wholeheartedly embraces the result of the election, confident that the delegates have cast their ballots for those for whom prayer and reflection have inspired them to vote.",
      "Within the administrative arrangements of the Bahá’í community there are a number of spaces that allow for the exchange of views, including cluster reflection gatherings, institutional meetings, and the Nineteen Day Feast. The National Convention is another such occasion, but unique in that it brings together the National Assembly and elected representatives from all parts of the country. The conduct of this consultative dimension of the Convention calls for thoughtful attention.",
      "Shoghi Effendi stated that the National Convention should “fulfil the functions of an enlightened, consultative and cooperative body that will enrich the experience, enhance the prestige, support the authority, and assist the deliberations of the National Spiritual Assembly.” Although delegates are to offer their views in a full, frank, and unhampered manner, he advised that time not be spent on problems of secondary importance and that disruptive forces, “which are but the outcome of human passion and selfishness,” should be resisted. Instead, the Guardian expected those assembled to “approach their task with absolute detachment” and “concentrate their attention on the most important and pressing issues” in order to obtain a “deeper and broader vision of the Cause through an increase in the spirit of unity and of wholehearted cooperation.” “The unfettered freedom of the individual should be tempered with mutual consultation and sacrifice,” he explained, “and the spirit of initiative and enterprise should be reinforced by a deeper realisation of the supreme necessity for concerted action and a fuller devotion to the common weal.”",
      "Throughout the community, as the processes of the Divine Plan have become more and more complex, the nature of discussions on matters pertaining to growth and development of the Faith has evolved. A distinctive conversation is carried out, sometimes formally and often informally, at various levels and in different configurations. In every setting, each participant, whatever the nature of his or her service, provides a particular contribution and takes away fresh insight. From this rich set of interactions about experience unfolding within the Plan’s framework for action, consensus on strategies and plans emerges naturally. Among institutions, discussions flourish in an atmosphere of love and genuine respect, and unity of thought is readily achieved. And in settings such as cluster reflection meetings and gatherings of tutors, children’s class teachers, or animators of junior youth groups arranged by the training institute, aspects of decision making related to expansion and consolidation are taken up by the body of the believers, enabling planning and implementation to become more responsive to local circumstances. This conversation of the Bahá’í world, grounded in allegiance to Bahá’u’lláh and safeguarded by firmness in His Covenant, increasingly transcends the habits of speech characteristic of an age preoccupied with trivial or misdirected interests. With time, accrued experience, and continued guidance, this ongoing conversation comes to be distinguished by a more worthy etiquette of expression and gradually clarifies ambiguities, expands participation, airs concerns, strengthens bonds of love and association, refocuses endeavour, reconciles differences, resolves problems, and contributes to happiness and well‑being.",
      "Your consultations with the National Assembly at the Convention take place within the context of the larger set of relationships that bind the Plan’s three protagonists and must increasingly reflect the features of this distinctive conversation. Each year the Riḍván message sets the stage for the discussions at Convention by conveying a sense of the current progress of the Bahá’í world and the work that lies ahead. Your contribution, though free and frank, is not characterised by insistence on personal opinion. While there may be a wide range of important topics, attention to the progress of the Five Year Plan and the requirements of its remaining years cannot be neglected. You bring to the Convention insights gleaned from the conversation unfolding within your region. In this way, you enrich the perspective of the National Assembly and become informed of its hopes, challenges, and aims. You enhance your own understanding of the affairs of the Cause from a national perspective and rededicate yourself to the community’s common enterprise.",
      "We are pleased to witness the promising advances in the deliberations at National Conventions in recent years, and it is our ardent prayer that you may arise to achieve the high aims set forth by the Guardian for this vital institution of the Cause.",

      ". . . The challenge you face in helping the friends in your community to understand the Bahá’í teachings and to apply them in their lives, as the forces of materialism continue to grow in strength, is appreciated by the Universal House of Justice. Enclosed for your reference is a letter recently written on its behalf to three believers in a neighbouring country who shared similar concerns about the struggles experienced by young Bahá’í men and women in their efforts to uphold the standards of the Faith, particularly those related to chastity and marriage. It is hoped that the points set out in the letter will assist you in your deliberations on the subject. As the letter makes clear, the issues involved can best be considered in light of the relationships that the Administrative Order seeks to forge among the individual, the institutions, and the community. While responsibility for adhering to the Bahá’í standard rests primarily on the individual believer, it is incumbent upon the institutions of the Faith to support the individual, largely through educational endeavours, and to foster a pattern of community life that is conducive to the spiritual upliftment of its members. It is understood, of course, that in the assumption of these and other sacred duties, Bahá’í institutions may find it necessary at times to take specific action as a means of protecting the community and the integrity of Bahá’í law.",
      "In discharging their educational responsibilities towards the body of the believers, the institutions of the Faith need to bear in mind how little is accomplished when their efforts are reduced to repeated admonitions or to dogmatic instruction in proper conduct. Rather should their aim be to raise consciousness and to increase understanding. Theirs is not the duty to pry into personal lives or to impose Bahá’í law on the individual but to create an environment in which the friends eagerly arise to fulfil their obligations as followers of Bahá’u’lláh, to uphold His law, and to align their lives with His teachings. The efforts of the institutions will bear fruit to the extent that the friends, especially those of the younger generation, find themselves immersed in the activities of a vibrant and growing community and feel confirmed in the mission with which Bahá’u’lláh has entrusted them.",
      "One of the most effective instruments at your disposal in this respect is the training institute. It strives to engage the individual in an educational process in which virtuous conduct and self‑discipline are developed in the context of service, fostering a coherent and joyful pattern of life that weaves together study, worship, teaching, community building and, in general, involvement in other processes that seek to transform society. At the heart of the educational process is contact with the Word of God, whose power sustains every individual’s attempts to purify his or her heart and to walk a path of service with “the feet of detachment.” The Guardian encouraged young believers to learn through “active, wholehearted and continued participation” in community activities. Addressed to one young believer, a letter written on his behalf explained: “Bahá’í community life provides you with an indispensable laboratory, where you can translate into living and constructive action the principles which you imbibe from the Teachings.” “By becoming a real part of that living organism,” the letter went on, “you can catch the real spirit which runs throughout the Bahá’í Teachings.” Such wholehearted participation in the work of the Faith provides an invaluable context for the exertion made by young and old alike to align their lives with Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings. This is not to say that individuals will not err from time to time, perhaps on occasion in serious ways. Yet, when the desire to uphold the Bahá’í standard is nurtured through service to the common weal in an environment of unfailing love and warm encouragement, the friends will not feel, in the face of such difficulty, that they have no other recourse but to withdraw from community activity out of a sense of shame or, worse, to cover the challenges they are experiencing with the veneer of propriety, living a life in which public words do not conform to private deeds.",
      "Clearly, then, individual moral development needs to be addressed in concert with efforts to enhance the capacities of the community and its institutions. The enclosed letter describes some of the characteristics of the community life that Bahá’ís, guided by the institutions, are striving to create. The environment sought is, at the most fundamental level, one of love and support, in which the believers, all endeavouring to achieve the Bahá’í standard in their personal conduct, show patience and respect to each other and, when needed, receive wise counsel and ready assistance. Gossip and backbiting have no place in the Bahá’í community; nor do judgemental attitudes and self‑righteousness.",
      "What is essential for every National Assembly to acknowledge in this connection is that, if mutual love and support within the community, important as it is, becomes the only focus, a stagnant environment engendered by an insular mentality will develop. The worldwide Bahá’í community is charged with an historic mission. It must acquire capacity to address increasingly complex spiritual and material requirements as it becomes larger and larger in size. The 28 December 2010 message of the House of Justice indicated: “A small community, whose members are united by their shared beliefs, characterised by their high ideals, proficient in managing their affairs and tending to their needs, and perhaps engaged in several humanitarian projects—a community such as this, prospering but at a comfortable distance from the reality experienced by the masses of humanity, can never hope to serve as a pattern for restructuring the whole of society.” The current series of global Plans sets out provisions for gradually building individual and collective capacity for the community’s mission. The institutions of a Bahá’í community that has been allowed to become complacent will find it difficult to protect the younger members from the forces of gross materialism, with the accompanying moral decay, that are assailing society. This, then, points to the nature of the capacity‑building process in which every Bahá’í institution must energetically engage.",
      "Apart from the measures noted above, which serve to reinforce the integrity of the Bahá’í community, there may be times when specific action is required on the part of the institutions to protect it and to uphold the law. Intervention in any specific case needs, of course, to be carried out with the utmost delicacy and wisdom. Such cases present themselves when the breach of Bahá’í law is public and flagrant, potentially bringing the Faith into disrepute and damaging its good name, or when the individual demonstrates a callous disregard for the teachings and the institutions of the Faith, with harmful consequences for the functioning of the Bahá’í community. In these circumstances, Spiritual Assemblies should follow a middle way: They should not adopt a passive approach, which would be tantamount to condoning behaviour contrary to the teachings and which would undermine the imperative to obey Bahá’í law in the eyes of the members of the community. Neither, however, should they act rashly or rigidly to enforce the law, imposing administrative sanctions arbitrarily.",
      "Should the conduct of a believer become so blatant as to attract the attention of the Assembly, it would want, after gaining a relatively clear picture of the issues, to offer loving but firm advice to the friend involved. In most cases it is necessary, in the first instance, to determine to what extent the believer understands the Faith and its standards. Dispassionate counselling, not infrequently over an extended period, to assist the individual concerned in gaining an appreciation of the requirements of Bahá’í law is generally required. So, too, is patience needed, and he or she should be given sufficient time to bring about a change. The Assembly, often aided by the Counsellors or the members of the Auxiliary Boards, may have to help the individual reflect on his or her particular circumstances, apply relevant principles, and explore available options. In deciding on what approach to take, the Assembly should be guided by the understanding that its objective is to assist the friends to draw closer to the Faith while taking care to protect the Bahá’í community from the negative influence of those who have no intention of adhering to its standards. When a believer demonstrates an allegiance to the Cause and a willingness to rectify the situation, continued patience and loving guidance are in order. All throughout, of course, care is taken to ensure that an individual’s struggles do not become a source of backbiting or disunity in the community. In this the members of the community need to remember that they should each focus their energies on their own spiritual development and on overcoming their personal shortcomings.",
      "Only in circumstances where a believer, ignoring all admonishments, persists in misconduct and knowingly and consistently violates the law, would it be necessary for the Assembly to consider applying administrative sanctions—this, after warning the individual of the consequences of his or her continued disregard for the teachings. The decision in such matters is left to the National Spiritual Assembly, which is to proceed with the utmost care and circumspection. What is at stake is the participation of the individual in those aspects of community life internal to the body of the followers of Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings, not his or her civil rights. In some cases, partial sanctions may be adequate, allowing the Assembly to deal with a situation in a flexible manner. For example, if the hope is to reawaken in the individual a desire to participate in community life, full sanctions may be counterproductive; an appropriate partial sanction, such as suspending his or her right to be elected to an Assembly, may prove sufficient, for, in any event, it would not be reasonable for a person who flagrantly violates Bahá’í law to be in a position to govern the affairs of the community. Restricting the believer from other forms of service—for instance, acting as a tutor of a study circle or as a children’s class teacher—may also be considered. Full removal of administrative rights should be reserved for the most severe and intractable cases, especially when the protection of the community becomes a concern. The wise use of partial sanctions thus provides the Assembly with another means of strengthening the individual and the community. In letters written on behalf of the Guardian advising Assemblies on such matters, he explained that, “although it is sometimes necessary to take away the voting rights of a believer for purposes of discipline,” this prerogative of the National Assembly “should be used only in extreme cases.” If heavy sanctions are applied to certain acts of immorality, he also observed, “it is only fair to impose equally heavy sanctions on any Bahá’ís who step beyond the moral limits defined by Bahá’u’lláh,” which would obviously, given the circumstances of humanity today, “create an impossible and ridiculous situation.”",
      "One final point deserves mention: There may be times when an individual who shows complete indifference to the counsels of the institutions and firm resolution in his or her desire to maintain the status quo has no apparent interest in engaging in the life of the Bahá’í community. In such a case, provided that his or her conduct has no significant bearing on the good name of the Faith, the Assembly may decide to leave the individual to go his or her own way, neither insisting on continued contact nor feeling obliged to impose sanctions. Equally, however, the Assembly need not be anxious about quickly removing the name of the individual from its rolls, given that circumstances change and a person may, over time, decide to mend his or her ways and return to participate in the life of the community.",
      "In considering matters such as those outlined above, both in handling particular cases and in addressing the broader question of cultivating an attitude of love and respect towards Bahá’í laws and standards, you will no doubt find ongoing consultation with the Counsellors both essential and illuminating.",

      ". . . You state that the disparity between the sexual mores of contemporary Western society and the standards of the Bahá’í teachings, which, you indicate, are “in accordance with the moral code of the East,” poses a considerable challenge to the current generation of young believers. In this connection you explain that, since, historically, a great deal of shame was associated with sexuality in European society, and so much energy was directed towards hiding and suppressing it, to abstain from sexual relations before marriage is now negatively viewed as pietism. You add that today marriage is delayed into the thirties after young people have completed their education and saved money for a home, that married life is more complex than in the past since both spouses usually work, and that those who profess ideals of chastity, as in the priesthood, often fall prey to illicit behaviour. Further, you suggest that many young Bahá’ís struggle to meet the standard of purity set forth in the teachings and that other young people may be reticent to join the Faith out of a reluctance to uphold it. The House of Justice appreciates the sincerity with which you have expressed your thoughts and acknowledges the very real sense of concern you feel, as the gulf between the principles laid down by Bahá’u’lláh and the generally accepted practices of society continues to widen.",
      "Young Bahá’ís in Europe face a particular challenge in this respect. Buttressed by its material and intellectual achievements and emboldened by a narrative of accomplishment and superiority that pervades its culture, the West puts itself forward in various ways as a model and measure for others. Yet, reflect upon ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá’s trenchant analysis of the limitations of European civilisation in His treatise The Secret of Divine Civilisation. Weigh carefully, next, His many exhortations to the individual in that same volume to “become a source of social good” and to “lay hold of all those instrumentalities that promote the peace and well‑being and happiness, the knowledge, culture and industry, the dignity, value and station, of the entire human race.” Far from allowing themselves to be acculturated to the standards of society, then, Bahá’ís are called upon to be the vanguard and champions of a new civilisation. The important issues you raise, therefore, need to be considered not only in the context of the current condition of society but also in light of the nature of Bahá’u’lláh’s laws and teachings and the responsibilities shouldered by every one of His followers, as well as by the community and the institutions of the Faith—this, if the potential to achieve His purpose for humanity is to be realised.",
      "We live in an age when the role of religion in shaping human thought and in guiding individual and collective conduct is increasingly discounted. In societies that have bowed to the dictates of materialism, organised religion is seeing the sphere of its influence contract, becoming confined mostly to the realm of personal experience. Not infrequently the laws of religion are regarded as arbitrary rules blindly obeyed by those incapable of independent thought or as a prudish and outdated code of conduct hypocritically imposed upon others by advocates who, themselves, fail to live up to its demands. Morality is being redefined in such societies, and materialistic assumptions, values, and practices pertaining to the nature of humankind and its economic and social life are taking on the status of unassailable truth.",
      "Indeed, the expenditure of enormous energy and vast amounts of resources in an attempt to bend truth to conform to personal desire is now a feature of many contemporary societies. The result is a culture that distorts human nature and purpose, trapping human beings in pursuit of idle fancies and vain imaginings and turning them into pliable objects in the hands of the powerful. Yet, the happiness and well‑being of humanity depend upon the opposite: cultivating human character and social order in conformity with reality. Divine teachings shed light on reality, enabling every soul to investigate it properly and to acquire, through the exercise of personal discipline, those attributes that are to distinguish the human being. “Man should know his own self,” Bahá’u’lláh states, “and recognise that which leadeth unto loftiness or lowliness, glory or abasement, wealth or poverty.”",
      "“The object of every Revelation,” Bahá’u’lláh declares, is “to effect a transformation in the whole character of mankind, a transformation that shall manifest itself, both outwardly and inwardly, that shall affect both its inner life and external conditions.” His appearance signals the emergence of “a race of men the nature of which is inscrutable to all save God,” a race that will be purified “from the defilement of idle fancies and corrupt desires” and that will manifest “the signs of His sovereignty and might upon earth.” The teachings of Bahá’u’lláh provide “such means as lead to the elevation, the advancement, the education, the protection and the regeneration of the peoples of the earth.” Thus, enshrined in His Revelation is a pattern for future society, radically different from any established in the past, and the promotion of His laws and exhortations constitutes an inseparable part of the effort to lay the foundations of such a society.",
      "It is evident that, if the body and mind are to maintain good health, the laws that govern physical existence cannot be ignored. So, too, for any nation to function properly, there are certain social conventions and laws that, everyone accepts, must be followed. In the same way, there are laws and principles that govern our spiritual lives, and attention to them is of vital importance if the individual and society as a whole are to develop in a sound and harmonious manner. In recognising the Manifestation of God for today, a believer also acknowledges that His laws and exhortations express truths about the nature of the human being and the purpose of existence; they raise human consciousness, increase understanding, lift the standard of personal conduct, and provide the means for society to progress. His teachings serve, then, to empower humanity; they are the harbinger of human happiness, whose call, far from compelling obedience to an arbitrary and dictatorial regimen of behaviour, leads to true freedom. “Were men to observe that which We have sent down unto them from the Heaven of Revelation,” Bahá’u’lláh states, “they would, of a certainty, attain unto perfect liberty. Happy is the man that hath apprehended the Purpose of God in whatever He hath revealed from the Heaven of His Will, that pervadeth all created things.” “Think not that We have revealed unto you a mere code of laws,” He declares further, “Nay, rather, We have unsealed the choice Wine with the fingers of might and power.”",
      "Throughout the world, in diverse cultures, Bahá’ís encounter values and practices that stand in sharp contrast to the teachings of the Faith. Some are embedded in social structures, for instance, racial prejudice and gender discrimination, economic exploitation and political corruption. Others pertain to personal conduct, especially with respect to the use of alcohol and drugs, to sexual behaviour, and to self‑indulgence in general. If Bahá’ís simply surrender to the mores of society, how will conditions change? How will the people of the world distinguish today’s moribund order from the civilisation to which Bahá’u’lláh is summoning humanity? “Humanity,” the Riḍván 2012 message of the House of Justice explained, “is weary for want of a pattern of life to which to aspire.” “A single soul can uphold a standard far above the low threshold by which the world measures itself,” the message noted. Young Bahá’ís especially need to take care, lest they imagine they can live according to the norms of contemporary society while adhering to Bahá’í ideals at some minimum level to assuage their conscience or to satisfy the community, for they will soon find themselves consumed in a struggle to obey even the most basic of the Faith’s moral teachings and powerless to take up the challenges of their generation. “Wings that are besmirched with mire can never soar,” Bahá’u’lláh warns. The inner joy that every individual seeks, unlike a passing emotion, is not contingent on outside influences; it is a condition, born of certitude and conscious knowledge, fostered by a pure heart, which is able to distinguish between that which has permanence and that which is superficial. “Wert thou to speed through the immensity of space and traverse the expanse of heaven,” are Bahá’u’lláh’s words, “yet thou wouldst find no rest save in submission to Our command and humbleness before Our Face.”",
      "The duty to obey the laws brought by Bahá’u’lláh for a new age, then, rests primarily on the individual believer. It lies at the heart of the relationship of the lover and the Beloved; “Observe My commandments, for the love of My beauty,” is Bahá’u’lláh’s exhortation. Yet what is expected in this connection is effort sustained by earnest desire, not instantaneous perfection. The qualities and habits of thought and action that characterise Bahá’í life are developed through daily exertion. “Bring thyself to account each day,” writes Bahá’u’lláh. “Let each morn be better than its eve,” He advises, “and each morrow richer than its yesterday.” The friends should not lose heart in their personal struggles to attain to the Divine standard, nor be seduced by the argument that, since mistakes will inevitably be made and perfection is impossible, it is futile to exert an effort. They are to steer clear of the pitfalls of hypocrisy, on the one hand—that is, saying one thing yet doing another—and heedlessness, on the other—that is, disregard for the laws, ignoring or explaining away the need to follow them. So too is paralysis engendered by guilt to be avoided; indeed, preoccupation with a particular moral failing can, at times, make it more challenging for it to be overcome.",
      "What the friends need to remember in this respect is that, in their efforts to achieve personal growth and to uphold Bahá’í ideals, they are not isolated individuals, withstanding alone the onslaught of the forces of moral decay operating in society. They are members of a purposeful community, global in scope, pursuing a bold spiritual mission—working to establish a pattern of activity and administrative structures suited to a humanity entering its age of maturity. Giving shape to the community’s efforts is a framework for action defined by the global Plans of the Faith. This framework promotes the transformation of the individual in conjunction with social transformation, as two inseparable processes. Specifically, the courses of the institute are intended to set the individual on a path in which qualities and attitudes, skills and abilities, are gradually acquired through service—service intended to quell the insistent self, helping to lift the individual out of its confines and placing him or her in a dynamic process of community building.",
      "In this context, then, every individual finds himself or herself immersed in a community that serves increasingly as an environment conducive to the cultivation of those attributes that are to distinguish a Bahá’í life—an environment in which a spirit of unity animates one and all; in which the ties of fellowship bind them; in which mistakes are treated with tolerance and fear of failure is diminished; in which criticism of others is avoided and backbiting and gossip give way to mutual support and encouragement; in which young and old work shoulder to shoulder, studying the Creative Word together and accompanying one another in their efforts to serve; in which children are reared through an educational process that strives to sharpen their spiritual faculties and imbue them with the spirit of the Faith; in which young people are helped to detect the false messages spread by society, recognise its fruitless preoccupations, and resist its pressures, directing their energies instead towards its betterment. The institutions of the Faith, for their part, strive to ensure that such an environment is fostered. They do not pry into the personal lives of individuals. Nor are they vindictive and judgemental, eager to punish those who fall short of the Bahá’í standard. Except in extreme cases of blatant and flagrant disregard for the law that could potentially harm the Cause and may require them to administer sanctions, their attention is focused on encouragement, assistance, counsel, and education.",
      "Such an environment creates a very different set of dynamics than the one found particularly in the highly individualistic societies of today. Marriage, for instance, need not be long delayed, as it is in some parts of the world where the maturity and responsibilities of adulthood are deferred in pursuit of the licence that a socially prolonged adolescence grants. For the individual, who both contributes to and draws strength from the environment that is the Bahá’í community, adhering to Bahá’í law is endowed with meaning and, though perhaps still difficult on occasion, does not pose the insurmountable challenge that you fear it will. . . .",

      "The establishment of ten Regional Bahá’í Councils in your country is an auspicious moment, occurring at a time when the Bahá’í community of the United States finds itself in a fortified condition, forward‑looking and eager to learn from experience. The Universal House of Justice is pleased to observe that the guidance provided in its messages on the Five Year Plan has been, and continues to be, the object of thoughtful study, forming the basis upon which systematic action is being undertaken. It is clear that the friends are acquiring greater familiarity with the dynamics of growth, especially when they see how a fresh sense of community life can emerge, within a neighbourhood or town, as the core activities called for by the Plan become deeply rooted.",
      "In each of your regions, encouraging signs appear. A perceived dichotomy that had arisen between classes offered for children living close to one another and centralised schools covering a broader area is yielding to a more mature understanding. Through participation in the courses of the training institute, an ever‑greater number of friends are enhancing their capacity to offer spiritual education to those they encounter in the wider society. Classes for the young initiated at the neighbourhood level for this purpose are multiplying. In those places where the junior youth spiritual empowerment programme has become firmly established, its importance as a vital component of the community‑building process is becoming increasingly apparent; it is more promising still that the first two clusters to function as sites for the dissemination of learning about this programme have now emerged. The spirit of collaboration among the institutions of the Faith, at every level of the administration, is more and more evident. These are the favourable circumstances in which more than four score believers, eager to stimulate the process of growth across the United States, are assuming their responsibilities as members of the newly reconstituted Regional Bahá’í Councils. They do so knowing that their primary task is to support and guide the work of expansion and consolidation in cluster after cluster. With this in mind, the House of Justice has requested us to convey a number of comments that it is hoped will be of assistance to these devoted friends as they embark on the work before them.",
      "The message of 28 December 2010 from the Universal House of Justice describing the features of the current Five Year Plan makes direct reference to the responsibilities exercised by Regional Councils. The House of Justice highlights, among other things, the need for Councils to pay close attention to the operation of the regional institute, including the scheme of coordination the institute establishes at the level of the cluster. The Councils must ensure, too, the timely appearance and dynamic functioning of Area Teaching Committees. The discharge of these duties, carried out with the assistance of the Counsellors and their auxiliaries, will serve to foster the participation of increasing numbers of the friends in a rising number of programmes of growth—and this, in turn, conduces to the sound development of the individual, the community, and the institutions. Overall, a Council would wish to be well informed about the conditions that prevail in each cluster in the region. Further, as you will be aware from the 12 December 2011 message of the House of Justice to all National Spiritual Assemblies, there are two complementary perspectives from which the Councils will be able to view the pattern of action in a cluster: the “three‑month cycles of activity through which a community grows” and the emergence of “an educational process with three distinct stages.”",
      "As they analyse what occurs in a cluster through successive cycles of activity, Regional Councils will benefit from drawing upon the system that has been developed in the Bahá’í world for the generation and dissemination of knowledge about growth; in this connection, the Councils’ direct relationship with the Counsellors assumes special significance. Thus will experience gained from the advancement of clusters in your own and other countries provide a store of insight as well as inspiration. Naturally, this knowledge will be derived not only from the successes that accrue, but also from instances where progress in a cluster is impeded. At the same time, a Council will be looking for signs that learning continues to be the mode of operation at the level of the cluster. As one cycle follows after another, there should be a steady rise in the friends’ capacity to apply the guidance they have received, to reflect on their own experience in light of what is being learned worldwide, to improve their efforts, and to surmount the obstacles they encounter.",
      "With respect to the educational process whose emergence in clusters is essential to the community‑building work everywhere, the 12 December message describes its dynamics in some detail. Although neighbourhood classes for the spiritual education of children and the junior youth spiritual empowerment programme both took some time to become well established in the United States, there is every sign that they are set to flourish. As indicated above, the prospects for the junior youth programme are especially bright. Its impact can be seen in the transformation that occurs within the junior youth who are its participants; they come to regard themselves as agents of social change, each endowed with a twofold sense of purpose that impels them to take charge of their own spiritual and intellectual growth and contribute to the welfare of society. It is noteworthy, however, that the programme’s beneficial effects are also apparent in the rapid moral and spiritual development of many young people, be they Bahá’ís or not, who are assisted to serve as animators.",
      "Regional Councils, then, should become adept at analysing the conditions in each cluster from both perspectives set out in the 12 December message. But from either perspective, the critical importance of systematically developing human resources—which lies at the heart of the Plan—must remain in view. For unless a capacity for human resource development is well established in a cluster, there can be no expectation of sustained progress. Conversely, a Bahá’í community that gains solid experience in this work will not only have enhanced its ability to attract growing contingents to the Cause of God; it will also find itself able to rally a perpetually expanding body of individuals dedicated to the transformation of the society around them.",
      "That this process should advance at varying speeds within various populations is to be expected; it is a natural feature of an organic phenomenon. It should certainly not become a cause of anxiety. The Plan’s methods and instruments endow the Bahá’í community with the means to labour effectively in every setting—from the university campus to the urban neighbourhood, from the rural town to the city suburb. Yet, as you clearly appreciate, to expect the rate at which growth occurs in one instance to be matched in every other, or to curtail the process within one population because others are not equally served, would be wholly unreasonable and ultimately counterproductive. In short, those responsible for coordinating the endeavours of the friends should be ever sensitive to the natural unfoldment of the processes they oversee—conscious of when greater intensity is required in one area and when patience and encouragement are called for in another. Within each population, the path of learning will thus open up.",
      "Accepting, indeed welcoming, the dynamics that characterise each set of circumstances will help the friends to refrain from drawing unhelpful comparisons between the progress experienced in one area or by one group of believers and that reported elsewhere. The friends will be involved in the work according to their capacities and the possibilities before them. Some will, in the settings where they find themselves, reach out to family, friends, colleagues, and acquaintances, inviting them to take part in core activities. Others will become integrated into neighbourhoods and dedicate themselves to assisting particularly receptive populations to advance along a path of spiritual development—giving rise to centres of intense activity. Of course, where a special measure of receptivity has been recognised, resources will need to be deployed to enable it to blossom. However, the institutions of the Faith need to guard against stifling an instance of rapid growth in a neighbourhood by calling on too many individuals from outside to become involved in fledgling efforts.",
      "The House of Justice has previously indicated, in letters written to you on its behalf, the importance of giving due attention to historically significant populations in the United States. This imperative remains. Today, the remarkable phenomenon of immigration that has accelerated in recent decades must also claim a major share of your attention. After all, immigrants— whether from the Latin regions of your own continent, across the Pacific from Asia or the Atlantic from Africa—constitute a sizeable proportion of the American population. Their sons and daughters now apparently number almost one in four of the children in your country. Among these families whose origins lie beyond your borders a vibrant sense of community is often more pronounced. Raising capacity within these populations to conduct classes for their children, and particularly to implement the programme for the spiritual empowerment of their junior youth, will enhance the vitality of community‑building endeavours in many clusters.",
      "Intensifying efforts to reach out to a receptive population carries certain implications for the scheme of coordination in a cluster. As indicated in the 12 December message, the International Teaching Centre is following experience around the world to articulate what form the elements of an effective organisational scheme assume under diverse circumstances. In this regard, the Counsellors and their auxiliaries will work closely with the Regional Councils, institute boards, and cluster agencies; your Assembly will, undoubtedly, wish to engage in regular consultation with the Counsellors on this theme to assess the implications of new insights for expansion and consolidation in the United States.",
      "This leads naturally to the consideration of some points that will require the close attention of your Assembly, for the acceleration of the process of growth has profound ramifications for the organisation of your National Centre. You will recall that a letter to you dated 19 October 2005, written on behalf of the House of Justice, explored in some detail the administrative challenges associated with large‑scale expansion. The broad principles elucidated therein continue to apply to your present situation. The letter highlighted the importance of decentralisation in order to allow for the necessary flexibility to respond to needs at the grass roots. While many productive steps have been taken, further changes are required to enable you to provide the financial resources necessary to sustain a rising number of programmes of growth. Moreover, it seems likely that the same flexibility—and, at times, innovative thinking—will be needed in the approach to the provision of funds to support part‑ and full‑time workers in the regions and clusters. It should be expected that, in the future, increasing responsibility will devolve to these levels. A periodic review of the mandates and the functioning of programmes and offices affiliated with your National Centre is necessary to ensure a suitable balance of structures and an appropriate distribution of resources at all levels. Even your internal arrangements for maintaining an open channel of communication between your Assembly and the Regional Councils would benefit from review so that you remain fully informed of advances made in the implementation of the Plan nationwide.",
      "A new chapter in the evolution of the Administrative Order in the United States is now opening, endowed with immense promise. As those dedicated believers called to serve on Regional Councils now take up their responsibilities, no doubt they will be conscious that they function as members of corporate bodies and not, of course, as individual leaders. Indeed, it will be essential for them to remain mindful of the admonitions in the Bahá’í writings that apply to all those charged with the administration of the affairs of the Faith—that they are to approach their work in the spirit of “humble fellowship” and that they must not allow themselves to be considered the “central ornaments of the body of the Cause.” So promising a process of growth unfolding in your country at the level of the cluster should not come to revolve around their expectations or to rely on their personal presence. Guarding against the least trace of any such tendency will greatly redound to their effectiveness. For the reality of the situation in many instances is that the richest experience exists at the grass roots, when a nucleus of believers labours intensively to build capacity within a population to take charge of its own spiritual and social advancement. All those who aim to assist the process of learning at this level must remain sensitive to conditions in individual clusters, lest frequent requests for reports or summons to gatherings—however well intentioned—sap energy or dissipate focus. Rather will they wish to do everything within their means to provide support, to lovingly encourage, to facilitate the efforts under way, and to respond, with flexibility and dispatch, to needs as they arise.",
      "The House of Justice deeply appreciates your earnest exertions to attend to the requirements of the Five Year Plan. It acknowledges receipt of your email letter dated 18 July 2012 enclosing the names of those believers who have the privilege to serve on the Regional Councils in the United States. You are assured that the House of Justice will offer its ardent supplications at the Sacred Threshold on their behalf. May Bahá’u’lláh continue to bless and confirm the endeavours of the American community in the path of service to His Cause.",

      "Our message dated 28 December 2010 to the Conference of the Continental Boards of Counsellors briefly described the process of growth which begins to unfold in a cluster, frequently as the result of a single homefront pioneer entering into meaningful conversation with local residents. We also indicated that more advanced clusters, in which the pattern of action associated with an intensive programme of growth has been firmly established, will often serve as reservoirs of pioneers who can be dispatched to other clusters, especially on the home front—in some to initiate a systematic approach to sharing Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings and in others to strengthen the processes of expansion and consolidation that have already been established. There is no doubt that the movement of pioneers remains an indispensable feature of the spiritual enterprise in which the community of the Most Great Name is engaged.",
      "During the Five Year Plan recently concluded, over 3,500 international pioneers entered the arena of service to reinforce the work of the Faith in myriad ways across the globe. At the same time, we were most pleased to see a surge in the movement of homefront pioneers, their numbers matching those who arose to serve in the international field and their sacrificial efforts making a distinctive contribution to the early attainment of the goal of the Plan. In the next five years, the successful prosecution of the Plan will require the services of several thousand consecrated souls who, spurred on by their love for the Blessed Beauty, will forsake their homes to settle in villages, towns and cities in order to raise to 5,000 the number of clusters with programmes of growth.",
      "National Spiritual Assemblies, in close collaboration with Continental Counsellors and Continental Pioneering Committees, will continue to play a crucial role in expanding the awareness of the believers about the critical needs of the Cause and in assisting with the settlement of pioneers in designated clusters. They will not, however, be asked to establish numerical goals at the outset, as was the practice in the past, for those to be dispatched beyond their borders during the coming five years. Rather, we will regularly call the attention of selected National Assemblies in different parts of the world to specific urgent pioneer needs, identified by the International Teaching Centre in the course of its ongoing endeavours to follow the progress of the Faith around the globe. It is hoped that National Assemblies will then be able to quickly send pioneers who respond to that particular appeal. In this regard, a promising pattern is developing in certain regions whereby believers arise to serve in a neighbouring country or in one that is further afield but within the same continent. This development brings with it the advantage of a more intimate familiarity with the culture and language of the country in which they settle, thereby increasing their effectiveness and the efficiency with which their services can be utilised.",
      "Beyond responding to the specific appeals for homefront and international pioneers that are issued from time to time by the institutions, the friends are of course welcome to arise at any time and from any place to settle in any area where they feel they can best contribute to the advancement of the Cause. Even so, their endeavours would yield greater effect if, drawing on the advice of institutions, they were to direct their efforts to clusters—indeed, villages and neighbourhoods within clusters—that are the focus of systematic attention. It is our ardent hope that the believers will arise rank upon rank, with a clarity of vision born of experience and with complete reliance on the confirmations of God, to offer His life‑giving Message to every eager soul, to every receptive population. Our prayers at the Sacred Threshold will accompany them as they strive to seize the abundant opportunities now opening before them.",

      "The Universal House of Justice appreciates your thoughtful inquiry concerning the relationship between eliminating racial prejudice and participating in activities of the Five Year Plan, which was presented in your email letter dated 13 October 2009. The delay in responding was unavoidable in order to allow the time necessary for consideration of the issues raised in light of the progress of the Plan. No doubt, you have by now carefully studied the message of the House of Justice dated 28 December 2010 to the Conference of the Continental Boards of Counsellors, which has a direct bearing on many of your questions.",
      "In your letter, you observe that the many activities carried out in the past by the American Bahá’í community to address racial concerns, despite their obvious merit and the results achieved to date, have been limited in their effect and have not been systematic in nature. Your review of such efforts suggests a cyclical pattern, with fits and starts, in which a certain course of action is presented with fanfare by the institutions, many believers take part although others remain on the sidelines, activities reach a peak, and then, after months or perhaps years, attention wanes, and the community is drawn to other areas until some incident occurs or a new heartfelt appeal is uttered, thus beginning the cycle anew. Simply to repeat the approaches implemented in the past, then, will surely not produce a satisfactory result. The House of Justice notes that the pattern you describe was a characteristic common to many facets of community life, leading it, in 1996, to set the Bahá’í world on a new course. During the Four Year Plan, it wrote:",
      "Our hopes, our goals, our possibilities of moving forward can all be realised through concentrating our endeavours on the major aim of the Divine Plan at its current stage—that is, to effect a significant advance in the process of entry by troops. This challenge can be met through persistent effort patiently pursued. . . . But also of vital importance to bringing about entry by troops is a realistic approach, systematic action. There are no shortcuts. Systematisation ensures consistency of lines of action based on well‑conceived plans. In a general sense, it implies an orderliness of approach in all that pertains to Bahá’í service, whether in teaching or administration, in individual or collective endeavour. While allowing for individual initiative and spontaneity, it suggests the need to be clearheaded, methodical, efficient, constant, balanced and harmonious. Systematisation is a necessary mode of functioning animated by the urgency to act.",
      "After a decade and a half of systematic effort, a coherent pattern of activity that advances the growth and development of the Bahá’í community and its greater involvement in the life of society has emerged. The current stage of progress and the challenges that lie immediately ahead are summarised in the Riḍván 2010 and 28 December 2010 messages. From this perspective, it is possible to see how the challenge of addressing racial prejudice is an integral part of three broad areas of activity in which the Bahá’í world is currently engaged: expansion and consolidation, social action, and participation in the discourses of society.",
      "The pattern of spiritual and social life taking shape in clusters that involves study circles, children’s classes, junior youth groups, devotional meetings, home visits, teaching efforts, and reflection meetings, as well as Holy Day observances, Nineteen Day Feasts, and other gatherings, provides abundant opportunities for engagement, experience, consultation, and learning that will lead to change in personal and collective understanding and action. Issues of prejudice of race, class, and colour will inevitably arise as the friends reach out to diverse populations, especially in the closely knit context of neighbourhoods. There, every activity can take a form most suited to the culture and interests of the population, so that new believers can be quickened and confirmed in a nurturing and familiar environment, until they are able to offer their share to the resolution of the challenges faced by a growing Bahá’í community. For this is not a process that some carry out on behalf of others who are passive recipients—the mere extension of a congregation and invitation to paternalism—but one in which an ever‑increasing number of souls recognise and take responsibility for the transformation of humanity set in motion by Bahá’u’lláh. In an environment of love and trust born of common belief, practice, and mission, individuals of different races will have the intimate connection of heart and mind upon which mutual understanding and change depend. As a result of their training and deepening, a growing number of believers will draw insights from the Writings to sensitively and effectively address issues of racial prejudice that arise within their personal lives and families, among community members, and in social settings and the workplace. As programmes of growth advance and the scope and intensity of activities grow, the friends will be drawn into participation in conversations and, in time, initiatives for social action at the grass roots where issues pertaining to freedom from prejudice naturally emerge, whether directly or indirectly. And, at the national level, the National Assembly will guide, through its Office of External Affairs, the engagement of the Faith with other agencies and individuals in the discourse pertaining to race unity.",
      "You indicate that some friends wonder whether the Guardian’s statement characterising racial prejudice as “the most vital and challenging issue confronting the Bahá’í community at the present stage of its evolution” still applies to the racial situation in the United States, since it was written so long ago. The House of Justice has determined that it is not productive to approach the issue in this manner, as it gives rise to an implicit and false dichotomy that, either what the Guardian said is no longer important, or it is so important that it must be addressed before or apart from all other concerns. Yet, the situation is infinitely more complex. The American nation is much more diverse than in 1938, and the friends cannot be concerned only with relations between black and white, essential as they are. The expressions of racial prejudice have transmuted into forms that are multifaceted, less blatant and more intricate, and thus more intractable. So too, the American Bahá’í community has evolved significantly and is no longer at the same stage of its development; it faces a wider range of challenges but also possesses greater capabilities. The House of Justice stated that the principles Shoghi Effendi brought to the attention of the American believers more than seventy years ago are relevant today, and they will continue to be relevant to future generations. It is obvious, however, that the “long and thorny road, beset with pitfalls” upon which the friends must tread, will take them through an ever‑changing landscape that requires that they adapt their approaches to varying circumstances.",
      "In the 28 December message, the House of Justice explained that “A small community, whose members are united by their shared beliefs, characterised by their high ideals, proficient in managing their affairs and tending to their needs, and perhaps engaged in several humanitarian projects—a community such as this, prospering but at a comfortable distance from the reality experienced by the masses of humanity, can never hope to serve as a pattern for restructuring the whole of society.” Even if such a community were to focus the entirety of its resources on the problem of racial prejudice, even if it were able to heal itself to some extent of that cancerous affliction, in the face of such a monumental social challenge the impact would be inconsequential. Therefore, the friends must effectively assess the forces at work in their society and, beginning in neighbourhoods and clusters, contribute their share to the process of learning and systematisation which, as their numbers, knowledge, and influence grow, will transform their lives, families, and communities. Only if the efforts to eradicate the bane of prejudice are coherent with the full range of the community’s affairs, only if they arise naturally within the systematic pattern of expansion, community building, and involvement with society, will the American believers expand their capacity, year after year and decade after decade, to make their mark on their community and society and contribute to the high aim set for the Bahá’ís by ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá to eliminate racial prejudice from the face of the earth.",
      "It is the ardent hope of the Universal House of Justice that the believers will appreciate the potentialities that exist within the current pattern of their organic activities for the realisation of Bahá’u’lláh’s highest aims for humanity and that they will seize their chance and commit their time, their resources, their energies—indeed their very lives—to these critical efforts for the betterment of the world.",

      ". . . The House of Justice is familiar with your views about the “double crusade” enjoined by Shoghi Effendi in The Advent of Divine Justice, as enumerated in your most recent letter as well as your letters of 6 November and 3 December 2009. You should rest assured that at every stage in the unfoldment of the Divine Plan, the Centre of Authority in the Faith establishes a framework for action to guide the believers in a united effort to apply Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings for the progress of the Bahá’í community and the building of a world civilisation. In the current series of Plans, the House of Justice has identified for the Bahá’í community the essential aim of advancing the process of entry by troops and has outlined the activities conducive to that end. The letter dated 28 December 2010 to the Conference of the Continental Boards of Counsellors sets out the features of the next Five Year Plan. It is hoped that the perspective provided in this letter will make it evident that the entire series of Plans since 1996 have indeed had at their heart the achievement of the double crusade, “first to regenerate the inward life of their own community, and next to assail the long‑standing evils that have entrenched themselves in the life of their nation.” The energetic prosecution of the Plan is, therefore, the surest and most expeditious way to achieve the objectives to which you aspire.",
      "You are free to share with your National Spiritual Assembly any specific suggestions you may feel are conducive to resolving the challenges facing the American Bahá’í community. However, you should not feel that, because particular recommendations are not adopted, the problems you perceive are being ignored. The activities of the current Plans provide new avenues for addressing the various facets of the double crusade. The culture of learning that has emerged in recent years allows the Bahá’í community to address such challenges in a systematic and ongoing manner in the context of the activities in a cluster. The process must inevitably unfold in an organic manner. Initiatives within the Bahá’í community will emerge at the grass roots in clusters where there is intensive activity; approaches that prove to be effective can gradually be shared with other areas.",
      "As new guidance is provided to the Bahá’ís of the world it is important that the friends welcome the challenge of learning to put it into effect without falling prey to an unfortunate duality that pits one position against another. In this particular instance, a perceived dichotomy between resolving racial prejudice and undertaking the activities of the Plan can be transcended through a process of study, consultation, action, and reflection as described by the House of Justice.",
      "Rest assured of the prayers of the House of Justice in the Holy Shrines that Bahá’u’lláh may continue to shower you with His confirmations and assist you in His service.",

      "The Universal House of Justice has received your letter dated 12 November 2009 in which you seek guidance regarding the means for ensuring, as a National Spiritual Assembly, that coherence is maintained between the process of social and economic development and those of expansion and consolidation in your country. You indicate that this question has occupied your attention for some time now as the number of Bahá’í‑inspired social and economic development initiatives in Papua New Guinea has increased. We are requested to write to you as follows and regret the long delay in doing so.",
      "The Universal House of Justice is heartened to note the progress that has been made towards the goal of establishing at least 27 intensive programmes of growth in your country by the end of the Five Year Plan, which draws rapidly closer. Clearly the attainment of this goal, which will provide a sound foundation for the further expansion and consolidation of the Faith throughout Papua New Guinea in the years immediately ahead, is of paramount importance. As you know, at the heart of the recent series of global Plans lies the question of capacity building, and it is in this light that the promotion of social and economic development can best be considered. Indeed, experience in Papua New Guinea provides useful insights in this respect.",
      "As you are aware from messages of the Universal House of Justice, sustainable progress in the expansion and consolidation of the Faith was achieved in cluster after cluster around the globe as men and women from within the local population—newly enrolled and veteran, young and old—were assisted through the institute process in their efforts to carry forward the work of the Cause themselves. Further, as more and more of the local population joined them, the scope of their efforts widened, and through the agency of the reflection meeting, they were able to lay down plans of action commensurate with their growing collective capacity. In short, they became active participants in the process of spiritual transformation under way in their communities.",
      "If projects designed to meet the material needs of a population are to contribute to its forward movement, and achieve coherence with efforts undertaken to address spiritual requirements, they must adopt similar approaches and methods. While not devoid of the delivery of services at the local level, Bahá’í projects of social and economic development, whether administered by the institutions of the Faith or by a Bahá’í‑inspired organisation, should be principally concerned with raising the capacity of the local population to make decisions about its own progress and implement them. In this connection, the House of Justice has been pleased to read reports of the effects of the programmes offered by the Rays of Light Foundation, which has been closely guided by the Office of Social and Economic Development at the Bahá’í World Centre. Evidence of the complementarity between its programmes and the work of expansion and consolidation, as currently conceived, is readily apparent.",
      "In your country, as in many others, there are of course development efforts undertaken by government agencies and nongovernmental organisations, often funded by large international donors, that follow approaches not necessarily consistent with the ideas expressed above. Bahá’ís in different fields of endeavour will often participate, in a professional capacity, in the implementation or administration of such projects, which, in their own way, benefit the population. In doing so, they should take care not to draw the Bahá’í community into their plans or impinge on its limited resources. Even greater caution must be exercised to avoid these tendencies when one or more Bahá’ís receive a grant to carry out a valuable service to the local population, as in the case of the Sírús Naraqi Foundation to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS—this, especially if they associate their efforts with the Faith in the eyes of the public in some way. . . .",

      "We have watched with admiration the eagerness with which the youth in the United Kingdom have stepped into the vanguard of the work of the Cause, reaching out to ever greater numbers of souls and engaging them in the community‑building activities that lie at the heart of the Five Year Plan. Your earnestness, your energy, your intrepid determination not to shirk the demands of this Day mark you out for this all‑important undertaking. Ably trained, spiritually enkindled, and eager for experience, you have arisen to seize the initiative in your immediate surroundings and beyond. The need for you to apply yourselves to service in two capacities in particular—as teachers of children’s classes and as animators of junior youth groups—has never been more apparent. Countless parents yearn for the means of developing their children’s spiritual faculties that would lay within them the foundations of a principled and upright character. And surely every young person will flourish in a programme that helps to form a strong moral identity in the critical years of early adolescence and empowers participants to contribute to the well‑being of society. Beyond these specific fields of activity, you must not refrain from acquainting your peers with the potent, the compelling, the world‑embracing mission with which you are charged. Which of them would not feel their spirits enriched for contemplating how, through the application of those far‑reaching principles enunciated by Bahá’u’lláh, the regeneration of the world can be accomplished and its perplexing crises resolved? Which of them would not be raised to a new consciousness of humanity’s capacity to “carry forward an ever‑advancing civilisation” by combining their energies with yours and bending them towards this noble aim?",
      "That the spirit of this gathering may galvanise your energies and strengthen your resolve; that you may pledge to intensify your efforts in the path of service to humankind; above all, that you may be the recipients of an outpouring of the favours vouchsafed by the Blessed Beauty to those who arise for His Cause—these are our ardent supplications at the Sacred Threshold.",

      "The Universal House of Justice has observed with great interest the strides that your community has made towards achieving the aim of the Five Year Plan. The hearts of your believers are no doubt uplifted by the prospect of launching intensive programmes of growth in each and every cluster in mainland Malaysia by the end of the Plan. The progress achieved thus far bears out the remarkable capacities of your community and leaves no doubt that such a marvellous feat is indeed attainable. The acceleration and coherence that your community is beginning to experience in its expansion and consolidation are hard‑won accomplishments, and much needs to be done to ensure the sustainability of the gains that are made. In this regard, the role that the Regional Bahá’í Councils play is crucial, and we have been asked to convey to you the following.",
      "A major reorganisation of the Regional Bahá’í Councils in mainland Malaysia took place last year when their number was reduced to three, resulting in larger areas of jurisdiction under each. This change provided a greater scope for these institutions to discharge their vital responsibility of overseeing the two essential movements of the Plan. The House of Justice feels that Regional Bahá’í Councils should now be given greater latitude in the discharge of their functions. At the cluster level, the friends are labouring assiduously within the framework of the Plan, laying a firm foundation for the expansion of the Bahá’í community and extending their outreach to their friends, neighbours and colleagues. It is essential that the Regional Councils, together with the Counsellors and their auxiliaries, help agencies at the cluster level meet the administrative challenges of large‑scale growth. For example, the Councils will need to assist them in the development of plans; enhance their capacity to collect, maintain and analyse statistical data; provide occasions for consultation and reflection among institutions and agencies; and ensure that the learning gained in one cluster is quickly spread to others. They would also communicate their plans to the friends on a regular basis. Moreover, your National Assembly will need to provide adequate resources, financial and otherwise, to each Regional Council in order for it to carry out its activities and support the work of the agencies serving in the clusters.",
      "Your decision last year to form three institute boards in order to harmonise the institute’s operation with that of the Regional Councils was a timely step. This has no doubt affected favourably the institute’s endeavours to raise up human resources through a formal programme of training, building capacity for service within the Bahá’í community and the larger society. The House of Justice feels that the administration of the training institutes should now be devolved to the Regional Councils. This would include the appointment of the board and the regional coordinator, as well as the approval of the budget for the training institute, which would become part of the regional budget that each Council prepares and administers. In their handling of all matters related to the institute, the Councils would, of course, work closely with the Counsellors.",
      "As the Regional Councils now take on more responsibilities, your Assembly and its agencies will naturally extend to them the necessary support and resources. Your communications in this regard would usually be conveyed formally. At other times, the officers of the National Assembly and other individuals serving at the national office may be in contact with the officers or members of the Regional Councils in a more informal way. In such interactions, it will be important that those at the national level remain mindful of the corporate nature of the Regional Councils and avoid the tendency to issue directives that should more properly come from the Council itself.",
      "It is noted in the minutes of your meeting of 7—9 August 2009 that you plan to give the Regional Councils a role in the development of the National Fund. You are encouraged to move forward in this direction, leading in due course to the establishment of regional branches of the National Fund.",
      "The House of Justice is confident that your exertions, augmented by those of the Continental Counsellors, who will consult and communicate directly and frequently with the Regional Councils, will go a long way towards strengthening these institutions which are to play such a vital role in the progress of the Cause in Malaysia. To this end the House of Justice will offer prayers in the Holy Shrines.",

      ". . . As your experience in the teaching field clearly demonstrates, there are indeed many individuals in your country who are open to the Message of Bahá’u’lláh and who can be attracted to His Faith. To the earnest teacher, there exists a variety of methods by which such receptive souls can be introduced to the divine principles and, eventually, guided to declare their belief in God’s Messenger for this day. . . .",
      "Beyond doubt is the compelling need to ensure that a seeker’s faith in the Blessed Beauty, by whatever means it has been awakened, is nursed to maturity. This process of spiritual development entails far more than is suggested by the term deepening; it carries with it an invitation to a higher consciousness of the purpose for which every individual human being was created. It implies a fundamental reorienting of a soul towards its Creator, an awakening to the personal and social implications of the Guardian’s statement that Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation is calling into being “a new race of men,” a wholehearted dedication of one’s talents and abilities to the attainment of that day when, the Blessed Beauty assures us, “all men shall be regarded as one soul.” The efflorescence of those talents and abilities and their channelling into specific acts of service is the goal that distinguishes the training institute process from activities intended to deepen new believers.",
      "The implications at the level of society are no less profound than those at the individual level. “All men,” Bahá’u’lláh asserts, “have been created to carry forward an ever‑advancing civilisation.” This, rather than the mere accumulation of religious converts, is the elevated goal towards which all our efforts in the teaching field are directed. The central purpose of the training institute process is to raise up human resources who can contribute to this objective.",
      "In countless instances—including in your own region—participants of the institute process, whether veteran Bahá’ís or those only recently acquainted with the Faith, have testified to the efficacy of the institute courses in opening their eyes to both a new conception of spiritual reality and its implications for the creation of a new civilisation, as well as empowering them to become an agent of the renewal society must undergo. The House of Justice is confident that in . . . there are innumerable souls who not only have the capacity to embrace this vision, but who are ready, even eager, to work towards its realisation.",

      "Your email letter dated 23 July 2008 has been received by the Universal House of Justice, which is heartened to see that you are engaged in such focused consultations on how best to develop the Yerrinbool Bahá’í Centre of Learning. You have raised a number of pertinent questions in this respect, especially related to the Centre’s programmes of study. While such specifics deserve ample attention, the House of Justice feels it would be timely for you to step back at this important juncture in the development of your community and survey from a broad perspective its challenges and possibilities. In this connection, we have been asked to write to you as follows.",
      "With the institute process so well advanced and the core activities flourishing in cluster after cluster, a systematic pattern of action has taken root in your community, and you can have every confidence that provisions are now in place to ensure Bahá’u’lláh’s Message reaches increasing numbers of people of all ages and backgrounds in your country. It will be essential, of course, for momentum to be maintained—indeed, accelerated. But there is no doubt that the prospects for the growth of the Australian Bahá’í community are bright.",
      "Like so many communities worldwide, then, yours will find itself being drawn further and further into the life of society in the years ahead as a natural consequence of its continued expansion and consolidation. The greater the clarity of thought you maintain about the nature of this challenge, already showing signs of the pressing demands it brings, the more effective will be the response of your community in meeting it. At this stage in your development, the House of Justice encourages you to begin to examine the work of your community in terms of three broad areas of action, which, though distinct from one another, each with its own methods and instruments, must achieve a high degree of coherence between them, if they are to reinforce one another and lend substantial impetus to the movement of the Australian people towards the spiritually and materially prosperous civilisation envisioned in the Writings of the Faith. What will ensure this coherence is the process of systematic learning that characterises them all.",
      "The expansion and consolidation of the Bahá’í community itself can be regarded as one area of action, the approach, methods and instruments of which are now well understood. Social action can be considered another. This term is being employed increasingly in consultations among Bahá’ís, as a result of heightened consciousness and enhanced capacity at the cluster level. It is to be expected that a desire to undertake social action will accompany the collective change which begins to occur in a village or neighbourhood as acts of communal worship and home visits are woven together with activities for the spiritual education of its population to create a rich pattern of community life. Social action can, of course, range from the most informal efforts of limited duration to social and economic development programmes of a high level of complexity and sophistication promoted by Bahá’í‑inspired nongovernmental organisations—all concerned with the application of the teachings to some need identified in such fields as health, education, agriculture and the environment. In this case, too, there is a vast amount of experience worldwide, fostered and correlated by the Office of Social and Economic Development, that has given rise to effective approaches, which can be exploited at the level of the cluster as soon as the processes of expansion and consolidation have advanced to the degree necessary.",
      "Efforts to participate in the discourses of society constitute a third area of action in which the friends are engaged. Such participation can occur at all levels of society, from the local to the international, through various types of interactions—from informal discussions on Internet forums and attendance at seminars, to the dissemination of statements and contact with government officials. What is important is for Bahá’ís to be present in the many social spaces in which thinking and policies evolve on any one of a number of issues—on governance, the environment, climate change, the equality of men and women, human rights, to mention a few—so that they can, as occasions permit, offer generously, unconditionally and with utmost humility the teachings of the Faith and their experience in applying them as a contribution to the betterment of society. Of course, care should be exercised that the friends involved in this area of activity avoid overstating the Bahá’í experience and drawing attention to fledging efforts of the Bahá’í community which are best left to come to maturity without interference, such as the junior youth spiritual empowerment programme. The development of instruments, methods and approaches for this area of activity is a chief concern of the Institute for Studies in Global Prosperity, based here at the Bahá’í World Centre.",
      "The House of Justice wishes us to emphasise that the above scheme should be regarded as merely one way of conceptualising the work of the Bahá’í community, one that avoids fragmentation and facilitates sound planning. It does not encompass the entirety of Bahá’í endeavour, the defence work being a case in point. Nor should it assume the status of a definition, as reflected in statements such as “There are three areas of Bahá’í activity.” Further, in no way should the friends feel there is a division of labour, in which one group participates in the work of expansion and consolidation, and another group in each of the other two areas. All Bahá’ís should engage in efforts to expand and consolidate the Faith. They also participate, to some extent, in social action and the discourses of society. In the case of the latter two, however, where the work takes on different degrees of formality, the nature of the tasks to be carried out can become quite complex and sometimes delicate, requiring specialised training and preparation.",
      "Indeed, it is in this context that the Universal House of Justice asks you to consider plans for the development of the Yerrinbool Bahá’í Centre of Learning. As currently conceived, the programmes of the Centre are intended to attract students who seek a deeper understanding of various facets of the Faith. However, you are encouraged to detach yourselves from the Centre’s past achievements, which have been undeniably praiseworthy, and determine dispassionately what role it would play in the above scheme. At the outset, it should be acknowledged that systematic study of the Faith will be a natural outgrowth of the culture of Bahá’í community life, in which the habit of reading the writings is fostered by the institute process and complemented by local deepening classes, conferences, winter and summer schools, and special gatherings devoted to specific subjects. So, too, will training needed to carry out programmes of social and economic development take place at the grass roots of the community. Much learning is still required, however, in developing human resources that can effectively participate in the discourses of society, and it is here that the Yerrinbool Bahá’í Centre of Learning can make a singular contribution.",
      "In that case, the nature of the Centre’s programmes would change. Still concerned with specialised aspects of the Faith, it would not conduct courses in Bahá’í studies in the same sense as those offered in universities by departments of religious studies, which, as you know, the House of Justice discourages since it could easily lead to a class of individuals in the Bahá’í community who assume a degree of authority on the basis of some formal qualification. Nor would the courses of the Centre simply repeat, in the final analysis, what will already be covered in local deepening classes. They would seek, rather, to relate the teachings of the Faith to a range of social issues, drawing on existing bodies of knowledge in such disciplines as history, economics, philosophy, political science and sociology. Decisions regarding the development of the Centre’s facilities and its recognition as a Private Higher Education Provider would need to be taken, then, in this light.",
      "The House of Justice looks forward to learning of the outcome of your consultations on this matter and assures you of its prayers on your behalf.",

      ". . . You ask whether the current focus on the core activities implies that other activities that have been pursued in the past, such as firesides, deepenings, proclamation activities, and travel teaching, are to be abandoned, and you question whether visiting believers and maintaining Assemblies in remote places are still important. You also express concern over what you perceive to be a shift in the locus of decision making away from elected bodies to appointed institutions, which has given you the impression “that believers at the grass roots are no longer being asked what they think, but are more or less being told what they should think.”",
      "As you know, during the time of the Guardian, emphasis was placed on establishing the Faith throughout the world and in raising up the administrative institutions that would provide the foundation for the prosecution of the Divine Plan. As the House of Justice observed in its Riḍván 2000 message, this task has been essentially completed. The Cause has now entered a stage in its organic development in which it is necessary to prepare the community for entry by troops and, beyond that, mass conversion. The current series of global teaching Plans have focused the energies of the Bahá’ís on stimulating the processes of growth and community development at the level of the cluster, and the friends have been encouraged to teach the Faith where they live. Those clusters with larger Bahá’í populations have been selected for close attention with the expectation that they can more rapidly advance, and the lessons learned can then be applied to other clusters. This does not mean that believers from clusters with smaller Bahá’í populations are to be neglected or that they need to wait in order to initiate their own programmes of growth. On the contrary, they should vigorously engage themselves in the development of the core activities, enthusiastically pursuing every avenue available to involve an ever‑increasing number of non‑Bahá’ís in their activities.",
      "The emphasis on the two essential movements of the Plan—the development of human resources through participation in the courses of the training institute and the progression of clusters through a series of developmental stages that result in the initiation of programmes of intensive growth—does not require that activities that have been pursued in the past be suspended. Rather, what it calls for is that those activities be assessed in the context of the needs, resources, and priorities of a cluster and that thoughtful decisions be made in the light of experience, with consideration being given to the most effective use of the resources available and the value of systematisation. While the House of Justice has emphasised that it is important for the friends to maintain focus on the essential activities of the Plan, it clarified in its message of 27 December 2005 to the Conference of the Continental Boards of Counsellors that “to maintain focus does not imply that special needs and interests are neglected, much less that essential activities are dropped in order to accommodate others. Clearly, there are a host of elements that comprise Bahá’í community life, shaped over the decades, which must be further refined and developed.” The maintenance of Assemblies in remote areas constitutes one such special need that is not to be neglected. Yet here, too, the accomplishment of this objective would be greatly facilitated by employing the instruments of the current Plan, which have proven so effective in fostering the growth and development of the community.",
      "Essential aspects of advancing the process of entry by troops are the strengthening and development of the three protagonists of the Plans—the individual believer, the institutions, and the local community—and the development of a culture of learning. Mistakes will be made as the friends adjust to the new requirements. But the House of Justice is confident that as experience and the capacity for learning increase, a greater measure of coherence among activities related to the expansion and consolidation of the Cause will be achieved, the complementary nature of the roles of the institutions of the Faith will be more clearly understood and the collaboration that is to take place among them will become more effective. It is important to keep in mind that we are in the early stages of a vast evolutionary process of development that will, in time, lead to a transformation in all aspects of the life of the Bahá’í community and the functioning of its institutions. . . .",

The friends should welcome these developments, while understanding that new approaches invariably bring with them challenges as well as new opportunities. The guidance of the House of Justice and the learning derived from experience will gradually resolve the challenges and any misunderstandings that arise as the process unfolds. Each believer can find an active role to play in advancing the programme of growth in a cluster, while contributing to unity and to the cultivation of an attitude of learning. As time passes, and the capacity and understanding of the believers in a cluster grow, the activities of the Plan will result not only in quantitative growth but also in an improvement in the quality of Bahá’í community life.",
      "As to the role of Local Spiritual Assemblies, you may be aware that many Assemblies are already making a great contribution to the progress of their clusters in the United States. This matter has been addressed in some detail by both your National Spiritual Assembly and Regional Bahá’í Council, and you may wish to contact them for additional information. It is true that the nature of the planning process in a cluster, even in those clusters that fall entirely under the jurisdiction of a single Assembly, has changed somewhat from the procedures followed in the past. Yet, it should be evident that the objective of the planning process, which is to mobilise an ever‑greater number of individual believers to actively participate in the systematic prosecution of the teaching work, has been quite successful. Members of Assemblies should therefore be patient and approach these new challenges with an open heart and mind and with a willingness to look beyond the transitory mistakes that may be made. Assemblies still shoulder a wide range of responsibilities beyond those that pertain to the teaching work, and as the number of believers in a cluster increases, additional responsibilities, including those deriving from a greater involvement in the life of society, will emerge. . . .",

      "We have received a letter from a believer in Írán with questions about the Guardianship and the Universal House of Justice. We appreciate that firmness in the Covenant is among the distinctive characteristics of the believers in that land, who are informed of the principles and essential facts pertaining to the succession of authority in the Cause. Nevertheless, none among them should hesitate to seek clarification of matters about which they have questions, for the enemies of the Faith are tireless in their attempts to sow seeds of confusion and doubt. Moreover, it is beneficial, in view of the beloved Master’s exhortations to us all to be ever‑vigilant concerning matters of protection, for the friends to review the relevant essentials from time to time. We have therefore decided to provide you with the following comments. . . .",
      "Questions concerning the Guardianship and the Universal House of Justice can be resolved through careful study of the writings of Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá and Shoghi Effendi and the elucidations of the House of Justice, which, ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá states, will “deliberate upon all problems which have caused difference, questions that are obscure and matters that are not expressly recorded in the Book. Whatsoever they decide,” He assures the friends, “has the same effect as the Text itself.”",
      "Prior to the passing of ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá in 1921, the provisions He had put in place in His Will and Testament to safeguard the Faith and ensure its steady advancement into the future were generally unknown. The believers anticipated a day when the Universal House of Justice would be established since it had been specifically mentioned in the Sacred Texts. There was, however, no definite understanding that there would be a Guardian. Indeed, Shoghi Effendi later indicated that he had no foreknowledge of the position to which he would be called. At most, he had reportedly thought the Will and Testament might charge him, as the eldest grandson of ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá, with responsibility for arranging for the election of the House of Justice. Only after the reading of the Will did the institution of the Guardianship become widely known, and the Bahá’í community worldwide acknowledged Shoghi Effendi as the Head of the Faith to whom all must turn.",
      "An attentive reading of ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá’s Will makes it clear that He did not indicate a predestined outcome but did provide for a number of circumstances which, depending on future conditions, might eventually confront the Faith. The second section of the Will, for instance, which refers only to the Universal House of Justice, with no mention of the Guardianship, was written at a time when His own life was in imminent danger and Shoghi Effendi was but a small boy. During that same period, ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá had made arrangements for the election of the Universal House of Justice to take place immediately, should the threat on His life materialise. Through the grace of God, the crisis passed, and it was ultimately left to Shoghi Effendi many years later, as Guardian and Head of the Faith, to determine the timing of the formation of the House of Justice. Early on he considered the possibility of holding the election soon after the passing of ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá, in which case the House of Justice and the Guardian would have functioned simultaneously. He determined, of course, that the foundations of the Administrative Order needed first to be firmly laid at the local and national levels, and it eventually transpired that the House of Justice was established several years after his own passing. That the transition from the ministry of the Guardian to the election of the Universal House of Justice occurred with such relative ease can, itself, be attributed to the way certain provisions in the Will were formulated.",
      "‘Abdu’l‑Bahá’s Will and Testament clearly allows for the possibility of a successor to Shoghi Effendi, and in this light, we find statements written by him or on his behalf over the course of his thirty‑six‑year ministry that envision future Guardians. However, there are no assurances in the Writings that the line of Guardians would continue throughout the Dispensation; rather, the possibility is envisaged that such a line would come to an end. In this respect, Bahá’u’lláh states in the Kitáb‑i‑Aqdas:",
      "Endowments dedicated to charity revert to God, the Revealer of Signs. None hath the right to dispose of them without leave from Him Who is the Dawning‑place of Revelation. After Him, this authority shall pass to the Aghṣán, and after them to the House of Justice—should it be established in the world by then—that they may use these endowments for the benefit of the Places which have been exalted in this Cause, and for whatsoever hath been enjoined upon them by Him Who is the God of might and power. Otherwise, the endowments shall revert to the people of Bahá who speak not except by His leave and judge not save in accordance with what God hath decreed in this Tablet—lo, they are the champions of victory betwixt heaven and earth—that they may use them in the manner that hath been laid down in the Book by God, the Mighty, the Bountiful.",
      "The passing of Shoghi Effendi precipitated the situation described, in which the authority vested in the Aghṣán—first in ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá and then in Shoghi Effendi—ended before the House of Justice was established.",
      "In His Will and Testament, ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá specifies in the clearest terms the conditions according to which Shoghi Effendi was to have named his successor as Guardian:",
      "O ye beloved of the Lord! It is incumbent upon the guardian of the Cause of God to appoint in his own lifetime him that shall become his successor, that differences may not arise after his passing. He that is appointed must manifest in himself detachment from all worldly things, must be the essence of purity, must show in himself the fear of God, knowledge, wisdom and learning. Thus, should the first‑born of the guardian of the Cause of God not manifest in himself the truth of the words:—“The child is the secret essence of its sire,” that is, should he not inherit of the spiritual within him (the guardian of the Cause of God) and his glorious lineage not be matched with a goodly character, then must he, (the guardian of the Cause of God) choose another branch to succeed him.",
      "The Hands of the Cause of God must elect from their own number nine persons that shall at all times be occupied in the important services in the work of the guardian of the Cause of God. The election of these nine must be carried either unanimously or by majority from the company of the Hands of the Cause of God and these, whether unanimously or by a majority vote, must give their assent to the choice of the one whom the guardian of the Cause of God hath chosen as his successor. This assent must be given in such wise as the assenting and dissenting voices may not be distinguished (i.e., secret ballot).",
      "The personal views of any individual regarding the above statement, no matter how learned, cannot compare with the Guardian’s infallible understanding of the passage. Shoghi Effendi, who faithfully adhered to the wishes of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá throughout his ministry, would never have been careless in a matter so essential to the integrity of the Faith as the question of the appointment of his successor. It is unthinkable that he would appoint someone to succeed him who did not possess the qualifications laid down by ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá in His Will. It is equally untenable to suggest that he would do so in a manner which deviated from the explicit requirements in that same document, which included the affirmation of his choice by nine designated Hands of the Cause of God, so that “differences” would “not arise after his passing.” How perverse the suggestion of the violators of the Covenant that Shoghi Effendi would ignore the Master’s instructions and make a veiled and indirect appointment of his successor! Rather should the fact that Shoghi Effendi did not name a successor be seen as a sign of his meticulous adherence to every word of ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá’s Will and an indication of his conclusion that there was no qualified individual whom he could appoint.",
      "Therefore, it should be clear to every steadfast follower of Bahá’u’lláh that the end of the line of Guardians was not the result of any decision or action taken by the Hands of the Cause of God following the sudden passing of Shoghi Effendi. The line was brought to a close when, compelled by existing circumstances and the strict provisions of the Will, Shoghi Effendi did not name a successor. To entertain the possibility that it may one day be re‑established is futile. ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá wrote that “ere the expiration of a thousand years, no one has the right to utter a single word, even to claim the station of Guardianship.” And in the same passage He exhorted the friends, “Should there be differences of opinion, the Supreme House of Justice would immediately resolve the problems.” The Universal House of Justice, soon after its formation, stated that it “finds that there is no way to appoint or to legislate to make it possible to appoint a second Guardian to succeed Shoghi Effendi.”",
      "While the line of Guardians has ended, the Covenant is preserved. The vast body of interpretations of Shoghi Effendi informs the decisions of the Universal House of Justice as the Faith continues its onward march. The unity of the Faith is safeguarded, and the realisation of Bahá’u’lláh’s great purpose for humanity assured. “The Hand of Omnipotence hath established His Revelation upon an unassailable, an enduring foundation,” Bahá’u’lláh has stated. “Storms of human strife are powerless to undermine its basis, nor will men’s fanciful theories succeed in damaging its structure.”",
      {
        "type": "break"
      },
      "With reference to the specific questions raised in the letter we have received, one concerns the meaning of the designation “Aghṣán,” as found in the Writings. While in some cases, as affirmed by the Guardian, the term applies specifically to Bahá’u’lláh’s sons, at other times it is used more broadly to include His male descendants. For example, in His Will and Testament ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá refers to Shoghi Effendi as “the chosen branch” (Ghuṣn‑i‑Mumtáz). The reference to Shoghi Effendi as Ghuṣn here—the singular form of Aghṣán—follows the usage of Bahá’u’lláh in relation to the titles He gave His sons, that is, the Most Great Branch, the Greater Branch, and the Purest Branch. A letter written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi explains that the word Aghṣán “refers to Bahá’u’lláh’s descendants”; another describes Hussein Rabbání, the Guardian’s brother, as “the grandchild of the Master, an Afnán and Aghṣán mentioned in the Will and Testament of the Master.” It is evident, then, that the designation Aghṣán, or Ghuṣn, includes Shoghi Effendi and the other male descendants of Bahá’u’lláh.",
      "If, at any time, male descendants of Bahá’u’lláh appear who are faithful to the Covenant, it would nevertheless not be possible for any of them to occupy the office of Guardian, for, as already explained, in the absence of appointment by Shoghi Effendi, they cannot claim the station of Guardianship and there is no way for one to be named to it by an act of the House of Justice.",
      {
        "type": "break"
      },
      "Another query concerns the establishment of the Universal House of Justice. Specifically, the question has been asked whether the functioning of an “officially recognised” International Bahá’í Court in the Holy Land, mentioned by Shoghi Effendi, was an essential preliminary step in the evolution of the Universal House of Justice.",
      "As you are no doubt aware, Shoghi Effendi explained that “‘Abdu’l‑Bahá, Himself, in one of His earliest Tablets, contemplated the possibility of the formation of the Universal House of Justice in His own lifetime.” The Master described the requirements necessary for its formation, which did not include the establishment of a religious court:",
      "The Supreme House of Justice should be elected according to the system followed in the election of the parliaments of Europe. And when the countries would be guided the Houses of Justice of the various countries would elect the Supreme House of Justice.",
      "At whatever time all the beloved of God in each country appoint their delegates, and these in turn elect their representatives, and these representatives elect a body, that body shall be regarded as the Supreme House of Justice.",
      "The establishment of that House is not dependent upon the conversion of all the nations of the world. For example, if conditions were favourable and no disturbances would be caused, the friends in Persia would elect their representatives, and likewise the friends in America, in India, and other areas would also elect their representatives, and these would elect a House of Justice. That House of Justice would be the Supreme House of Justice. That is all.",
      "Over the thirty‑six years of his ministry, as he guided the Bahá’í world, striving to lay the foundations of the Administrative Order, Shoghi Effendi outlined specific developmental steps to be taken, which were intended to lead to the eventual establishment of the Universal House of Justice. The accomplishment of some depended largely on the exertions of the believers themselves—an increase in the number of Local and National Spiritual Assemblies, the appointment of the International Bahá’í Council and its evolution into an elected body. Others, however, were subject to the forces operating in society and, no matter what the efforts made by the Bahá’í community, could not be accomplished.",
      "In 1929, for instance, the Guardian stated, “given favourable circumstances, under which the Bahá’ís of Persia and of the adjoining countries under Soviet rule may be enabled to elect their national representatives . . . the only remaining obstacle in the way of the definite formation of the International House of Justice will have been removed.” Later, following the expulsion of Bahá’ís from Russia by the authorities, a letter written on his behalf explained, “At the time he referred to Russia there were Bahá’ís there, now the Community has practically ceased to exist; therefore the formation of the International House of Justice cannot depend on a Russian National Spiritual Assembly.”",
      "In the same way, goals were specified by Shoghi Effendi for the establishment of Bahá’í courts, including national courts in certain countries in Asia and, as a step in the development of the International Bahá’í Council, the precursor to the Universal House of Justice, a court in the Holy Land. Recognition by the Egyptian government of the National Spiritual Assembly as an independent Bahá’í court was sought as far back as 1929. Over time, changing conditions rendered the formation of such religious courts impossible. As the Hands of the Cause of God commented in 1959 in calling for the election of the International Bahá’í Council and the eventual establishment of the House of Justice,",
      "We wish to assure the believers that every effort will be made to establish a Bahá’í Court in the Holy Land prior to the date set for this election. We should however bear in mind that the Guardian himself clearly indicated this goal, due to the strong trend towards the secularisation of Religious Courts in this part of the world, might not be achieved.",
      {
        "type": "break"
      },
      "Yet another question that has been raised concerns the discharge by the Universal House of Justice of certain functions previously performed by the Guardian. With regard to Ḥuqúqu’lláh, ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá has explained that “Disposition of the Ḥuqúq, wholly or partly, is permissible, but this should be done by permission of the authority in the Cause to whom all must turn.” Likewise, the expulsion of Covenant‑breakers is an obligation exercised by the Head of the Faith in the context of the duty to protect the Cause from those who would seek to undermine its unity. Shoghi Effendi, it is well known, was obliged to expel Covenant‑breakers from the Faith at different points throughout his ministry, both before and after the appointment of the Hands of the Cause of God. This responsibility now falls on the Universal House of Justice, as the centre of authority to whom all must turn. The current procedures followed in this respect are outlined in the statement “The Institution of the Counsellors.”",
      "In this connection it should be noted that after the passing of Shoghi Effendi, although overwhelmed with grief, the Bahá’í world maintained its unity during the tenuous period between his ministry and the election of the Universal House of Justice. The sole challenge to its integrity appeared some two years after his death when Charles Mason Remey, who was at that time one of the Hands of the Cause, laid claim to the Guardianship. As you are aware, Remey asserted that his appointment in 1951 as president of the nascent International Bahá’í Council meant that he should automatically assume the position of head of the Universal House of Justice and was, therefore, the second Guardian.",
      "The absurdity of Remey’s claim is obvious and requires little elaboration. In 1957, he was among the Hands of the Cause who gathered in the Holy Land to consider what course of action should be taken following the unexpected passing of the Guardian. He personally affirmed that Shoghi Effendi had appointed no successor, signing a document issued unanimously by the Hands to this effect. As signatory to yet another such document, he agreed that the entire body of the Hands of the Cause would determine when and how the evolution of the International Bahá’í Council would culminate in the election of the House of Justice. For two years, as one of the nine Hands designated to serve in the Holy Land, he participated in the consultations that guided the development of the Bahá’í community. Then, without notice or discussion with his fellow Hands, he claimed the station of Guardianship, lacking explicit appointment by Shoghi Effendi as specified in the Will and Testament and in direct violation of the command of ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá that no one could make such a claim. Exercising the authority conferred on them in accordance with ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá’s Will, the Hands of the Cause expelled him from the Faith as a Covenant‑breaker.",
      {
        "type": "break"
      },
      "In matters related to the Covenant, the friends must be firm and steadfast; they should be wary, lest the arguments put forward by those who sow seeds of doubt become the cause for confusion or lead to disputation and disunity. Should questions arise that cannot be resolved, they should be placed immediately before the Universal House of Justice. The friends must be especially careful to avoid being enticed by the whisperings of the remnants of the Covenant‑breakers and their supporters, who seek to shake the believers’ faith. Whereas in the past the violators of the Covenant sought to undermine the authority of Bahá’u’lláh, ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá and Shoghi Effendi, today they challenge the Universal House of Justice. Of particular concern are those who, as ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá warns, “assert their firmness and steadfastness in the Covenant but when they come across responsive ears they secretly sow the seeds of suspicion.”",
      "Remey’s small band of associates, bedevilled by half a century of infighting among competing factions, have had negligible effect on the progress of the Faith. The flurry caused by their actions does nothing more than shake a few lifeless twigs and leaves from the tree of the Cause. Those who are naive, those who are not deepened in the Teachings or not firm in the Covenant, those who are controlled by their egos and lust for leadership can be misled and fall away. The friends are urged to protect themselves and their community by adhering strictly to the emphatic exhortations repeated throughout the Sacred Texts. As ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá states,",
      "Unto the Most Holy Book every one must turn and all that is not expressly recorded therein must be referred to the Universal House of Justice. That which this body, whether unanimously or by a majority doth carry, that is verily the Truth and the Purpose of God Himself. Whoso doth deviate therefrom is verily of them that love discord, hath shown forth malice and turned away from the Lord of the Covenant. By this House is meant that Universal House of Justice which is to be elected from all countries, that is from those parts in the East and West where the loved ones are to be found, after the manner of the customary elections in Western countries such as those of England. . . .",
      "And now, one of the greatest and most fundamental principles of the Cause of God is to shun and avoid entirely the Covenant‑breakers, for they will utterly destroy the Cause of God, exterminate His Law and render of no account all efforts exerted in the past. O friends! It behoveth you to call to mind with tenderness the trials of His Holiness, the Exalted One, and show your fidelity to the Ever‑Blest Beauty. The utmost endeavour must be exerted lest all these woes, trials and afflictions, all this pure and sacred blood that hath been shed so profusely in the Path of God, may prove to be in vain. . . .",
      "O ye beloved of the Lord! Strive with all your heart to shield the Cause of God from the onslaught of the insincere, for souls such as these cause the straight to become crooked and all benevolent efforts to produce contrary results.",
      "The believers in the Cradle of the Faith, who have withstood for more than a century the onslaught of government and clergy, who triumphed over the perils posed by the rebellions of Azal and Muḥammad‑‘Alí, who severed themselves from those who opposed Shoghi Effendi, will easily discount the spurious and ridiculous arguments of those few individuals who vie among themselves to exploit Remey’s deviation as a pretext for attracting a handful of personal followers. Be assured of our supplications at the Holy Threshold on behalf of the beloved friends everywhere in that sacred land.",

The Council is clearly conscious of the weighty responsibilities with which it has been entrusted and recognises that the success of the efforts to advance the process of entry by troops across the region will depend, in no small measure, on your wholehearted and sacrificial participation in the plans of action now in place. We applaud the Council’s decision and urge you to take advantage of the opportunity to contribute to the progress of the Cause in your communities.",
      "From your study of our 17 January 2003 message to the Bahá’ís of the world, you know that the challenge facing the institutions of the Faith in every part of the globe is to stimulate the movement of the clusters in their respective areas of jurisdiction from one stage of growth to the next. You are also well aware that this movement receives its impetus from another, that is, from the steady flow of believers through the sequence of courses adopted by their training institutes. In those clusters where the institute process is well established, three key activities—study circles, devotional meetings and children’s classes—tend to multiply with relative ease, creating an initial pattern of growth, to which other elements must then be added. Multiplying these activities ranks high among the priorities of the institutions everywhere, and you should not underestimate the importance of the part Bahá’í youth must play in this mighty endeavour. Who more than the young people of our communities can lend the collective energy needed to achieve so necessary an increase in the level of activity?",
      "We hope, then, that you will become the most enthusiastic participants in the programmes of growth in your clusters. You should take up with a true sense of responsibility, and in a spirit of joy that service to the Faith evokes, the task of rapidly increasing the number of study circles, devotional meetings and children’s classes in the Western States. Your efforts to meet this challenge will be greatly enhanced if you constantly seek out receptive souls in your schools, at your universities, and in the workplace and invite them to join you in your systematic study of institute courses.",
      "Now more than ever you should be attuned to the interests of your peers and be confident that many will welcome the opportunity to delve into the Writings with you. The widespread turmoil in the world, so graphically displayed by ongoing occurrences, brings with it a heightened degree of receptivity to the Cause, especially among young people. You should remain ever conscious of the forces at work in society and seize on the opening they provide for you to extend the influence of the Faith. Your peers long to make sense of the events they see unfolding around them, both at home and on the global scene. You alone have the Message that can soothe their troubled hearts and provide them with the clarity of thought they desire. Be assured of our prayers at the Sacred Threshold on your behalf.",

      "In the months since the launching of the Five Year Plan, national communities have adopted measures that are giving a dynamic thrust and added coherence to their activities. By now, in most countries the National Spiritual Assembly, or its Regional Councils, will have surveyed the territory under its jurisdiction and divided it into small geographic clusters, in keeping with the criteria set forth in our letter dated 9 January 2001. These clusters are being categorised according to their current stage of development, and plans of action devised to promote in them growth from one stage to the next. We could not be more gratified by the eager response of the institutions everywhere to the requirements of the Five Year Plan.",
      "The clearly defined plans now in place multiply teaching opportunities for those wishing to serve the Faith in the international field as short‑ or long‑term pioneers. Most of the needs of the clusters in a given country should increasingly be met by homefront pioneers as the Plan unfolds. But, given the sheer number of geographic areas which require systematic attention in order to advance, international pioneers will have a notable role to play. Their participation will be especially effective in the programmes of growth spreading throughout the world if they have developed abilities to foster the institute process. Beyond this, international pioneers and travelling teachers can contribute significantly to the work of the Faith in such spheres of activity as administration, proclamation, and social and economic development. A document has been prepared by the International Teaching Centre which briefly describes the conditions of national Bahá’í communities and the endeavours that could benefit from outside assistance. It will soon be available to you through National Spiritual Assemblies and the Counsellors and their auxiliaries.",
      "The movement of pioneers and travelling teachers from one place to another is an indispensable feature of the Bahá’í community. In the Twelve Month Plan alone, over 1,800 believers from nearly 90 countries set out to serve the Faith in the international field. Apart from the services such staunch souls are able to render to the Cause of God, this intermingling of the peoples of the world is vital to the patterns of life that the followers of Bahá’u’lláh are striving to establish and which are destined to provide an example for the rest of humanity to emulate. As the Bahá’í community continues to grow in capacity, it should give increasing attention to bringing together the diverse members of the human race in ever closer association.",
      "At this important juncture in the development of the Faith, when the systematisation of the teaching work is gaining momentum in all parts of the globe and integrating forces are propelling society towards Bahá’u’lláh’s design, every faithful servant of the Cause must be galvanised by the vision of splendid accomplishments ahead. We call upon you to consider your circumstances, examine the conditions of various countries, determine where you can best serve the needs of the Faith, and take resolute action. Let those who long to partake of the joy of such meritorious service go forth well assured that our prayers will accompany them, and fully expectant of Divine confirmations.",

      "The Five Year Plan, which will undoubtedly be the focus of your consultations over the next few days, requires concentrated and sustained attention to two essential movements. The first is the steady flow of believers through the sequence of courses offered by training institutes, for the purpose of developing the human resources of the Cause. The second, which receives its impetus from the first, is the movement of geographic clusters from one stage of growth to the next. That Bahá’í youth must be intensely involved in both of these—indeed, that they must be a driving force behind them—goes without saying. We urge you, then, to cast your deliberations in the framework of these two pressing requirements.

These are the years during which the Bahá’í community must make a significant advance in the process of entry by troops. Now is the time to teach.

The growing receptivity of the peoples of the world to Bahá’u’lláh’s Message reinforces our conviction that entry by troops will soon become an established pattern for the growth of the Faith in country after country.",
      "To assist the National Spiritual Assemblies and all the friends to understand, welcome, initiate and sustain this process, we are enclosing a compilation entitled “Promoting Entry by Troops” and a covering statement prepared by the Research Department. Whoever studies these illuminating passages will perceive that entry by troops is not merely a stage of the progress of the Cause destined to occur in its own good time, dependent on the receptivity of the population as a whole—it is a phenomenon which the Bahá’í communities, by their own activities, can prepare for and help to bring about. It is also a process which, once started, can be sustained. By a wise allocation of resources and the energetic pursuit of simultaneous plans of expansion, deepening and consolidation, the process of entry by troops should bring about a rapidly increasing supply of active believers, soundly based local communities, and steadily evolving local and national Bahá’í institutions.",
      "The Bahá’í world needs to foster a united clarity of vision for the expansion of the Cause and all its agencies, and a wide range of activities suited to the differing conditions of both the general population and the individual Bahá’ís. We therefore urge the friends, and especially the Assemblies, to study this compilation, to understand the coherence of its statements, and to use its counsels to lend a renewed impetus to the spread of the Faith and the establishment of the institutions of the Cause of God.",
      "Above all, in every aspect of teaching the Message, the friends should have confidence in the regenerative power of the Word of God, seek strength from the hosts of divine assistance, and anticipate the bounties that will continually be showered upon them. To build a new world is no easy task. The road is stony and filled with obstacles, but the journey is infinitely rewarding.",

      "1. Too narrow and limited understanding of the Faith and its Teachings on the part of certain Bahá’í scholars.

An attitude to the Faith and the Administrative Order which is strongly coloured by an assumption that the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh is similar to other religions and organisations, is afflicted by the attitudes which have too often characterised them, and is motivated by unethical considerations. The institutions of the Cause are regarded with the same suspicion as the traditional “establishment”. This produces a failure to understand, let alone accept, the points which the Universal House of Justice itself is striving to convey.",

      "4. Failure to use the appeal processes of the Cause by scholars who are faced with what they regard as improper and unjustified questioning of their writings by Bahá’í reviewing committees. It is natural that, in the present stage of the development of the Cause, the members of reviewing committees will, from time to time, err in their views or be unreasonably obtuse. Such errors and attitudes should be overcome through discussion between the author and the members of the committee. If this does not lead to a satisfactory outcome, the author can appeal to the National Spiritual Assembly itself and, if even that does not solve the matter, to the Universal House of Justice.",
      "5. The above attitudes, in turn, lead to an inability on the part of those scholars to describe the review process to their non‑Bahá’í colleagues in terms that would not be unacceptable in an academic environment.",
      "Your suggestion that an “imprimatur” system such as used by the Roman Catholic Church would be preferable to the present system of review was considered by the House of Justice, and it has asked us to explain to you the problems that this would present.",
      "First of all, it would convey to the reader the false impression that the attitude of the Faith was similar to that of the Roman Catholic Church, summoning up visions of an “index” of prohibited reading, and all the other associations which you can undoubtedly imagine for yourself.",
      "Secondly, it would give force to the erroneous concept that there are two kinds of Bahá’í literature: books which present the “official” view and those which are the free personal opinions of individual Bahá’ís, thus obscuring the essential Bahá’í differentiation between the Writings of the Báb and Bahá’u’lláh, those of ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá, the letters of the Guardian and the decisions of the Universal House of Justice, which are authoritative, on the one hand, and all other writings by Bahá’ís on the other, which have no authority at all apart from their own internal reasonableness. That a book has passed review in no way guarantees its correctness; it is merely an assurance by the National Spiritual Assembly concerned that, in its view, the book does not seriously distort the Faith or its Teachings.",
      "Thirdly, it would obscure the important fact that the process of review in the Bahá’í Faith is temporary, being limited to this stage of its development when books published by Bahá’ís could seriously mislead the public if they too gravely distort its message.",
      "Your proposal that a National Spiritual Assembly which detected major inaccuracies in an article published by a Bahá’í in an academic journal could have the Research Department “write a letter to the concerned journal pointing out and listing these inaccuracies, giving the requisite textual evidence in footnotes”, that journal editors would be “quite willing to entertain such correspondence” and that it would be found that Bahá’í scholars would be “grateful for chance to discuss such issues freely” introduces a new kind of discrimination and interference. Bahá’í institutions very seldom write to journals to correct their statements about the Faith; not only do they not wish to promote public disputes with those who write about the Cause, but the correction of such errors is seldom worth the time and effort necessary. In the coming years there will be numerous non‑Bahá’ís, ranging from those who are bitter enemies of the Cause to those who are its warm advocates, publishing articles about it. There is no way in which Bahá’í institutions could write corrections of the multitudinous errors that will be published; how, then, would they be justified in writing to correct only the errors perpetrated by Bahá’í authors?",
      "The House of Justice suggests that you consider the following steps through which the scholars of the Faith can overcome the problems which some of them perceive as presented by review of their publications.",
      "Let them accept unreservedly that ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá was right in instituting the temporary system of review, and that the decisions of the Guardian and the Universal House of Justice to not yet eliminate the system are in accordance with the Divine Will.",
      "Let them recognise the fundamental difference between errors propagated by Bahá’ís from those issuing from non‑Bahá’í sources. The review system is not an attempt to prevent errors or attacks on the Faith from being published; it is an attempt to prevent Bahá’ís from promulgating them in their published writings.",
      "Let them strive to understand the wisdom of this policy and its true nature, and to present it in its proper light to their fellow‑academics. . . .",
      "Let Bahá’í scholars look upon their fellow Bahá’ís with trust and affection, not with disdain as to their qualifications and suspicion as to their motives. Let them regard them as devoted Bahá’ís striving to perform a service which the policies of the Faith require of them. And let them not hesitate to discuss openly with such reviewers the points which they raise. If it appears that a National Spiritual Assembly does not permit such open discussion, let them appeal to the Universal House of Justice for clarification of the situation. It is well understood by the Universal House of Justice that in some cases the process of review works inefficiently and with problems. These deficiencies could be overcome if the scholars themselves would collaborate with the process and openly raise questions about its functioning, rather than fostering an atmosphere of antagonism and mutual mistrust.",
      "If the question of review is raised by non‑Bahá’í academics, let the Bahá’í academics say that in this early stage in the development of the Faith this is a species of peer review which they welcome, since it is primarily among their fellow‑Bahá’ís that they would find at this time those who would have sufficiently wide and deep understanding of the Faith and its Teachings to raise issues of importance which they would want to consider before publication. Of course, to be able to say this with sincerity, the scholars must have been able to accept the other steps mentioned above.",
      "You cite the case of Bahá’ís in other fields of expertise, such as Bahá’í physicians who, you say, “may pursue their professions as Bahá’ís with no prospect of interference by Bahá’í institutions”. This is hardly the case. All Bahá’ís are subject to Bahá’í law and Bahá’í standards. It would clearly be unacceptable for a Bahá’í doctor to advocate abortion as a method of birth control and set up a clinic for that purpose, or for a Bahá’í psychiatrist to publicly advocate sexual intercourse before marriage.",
      "Bahá’u’lláh was addressing all of us when He wrote: “Were any man to taste the sweetness of the words which the lips of the All‑Merciful have willed to utter, he would, though the treasures of the earth be in his possession, renounce them one and all, that he might vindicate the truth of even one of His commandments, shining above the Dayspring of His bountiful care and loving‑kindness” and “Whoso hath inhaled the sweet fragrance of the All‑Merciful, and recognised the Source of this utterance, will welcome with his own eyes the shafts of the enemy, that he may establish the truth of the laws of God amongst men.”",
      "Finally, the House of Justice wishes us to say that it fully agrees with your statement that it is important for the Faith to attract intellectuals and, indeed, all people of capacity in any field. Bahá’ís who themselves are intellectuals can contribute signally to this process, but not by ignoring the basic standards of faith and conduct that apply to all believers or by depicting the Bahá’í administration as a bureaucratic hindrance to freedom of thought and expression."

      "With regard to the current policy of advance review, all Bahá’ís, whatever their professions, are challenged to reflect on the implications of our common struggle to achieve Bahá’u’lláh’s purpose for the human race, including the use of our intellectual resources to gain deeper understanding of that Revelation and to apply its principles. In pursuing this course that has been set for it so explicitly and emphatically by its Founder, the Bahá’í community acts through the institutions that He has provided.",
      "Scholarly endeavours are not an activity apart from this organic process, answering to standards and operating on authority outside it. The House of Justice believes that part of the difficulty that some Bahá’í academics are having with the question of pre‑publication review may arise from the fact that, in their scholarly work, such believers do not see themselves as full participants in this process, free to act with the spiritual autonomy they exercise in other aspects of their lives. What the Bahá’í community is engaged in bringing into visible expression is a new creation. In this, the Cause has urgent need of the unfettered and wholehearted assistance of its scholars. The House of Justice has sought to point out that, as in every other field of Bahá’í endeavour, there are certain conditions under which this assistance may be rendered, conditions implicit in the nature of the process and made explicit in the Divine Text.",
      "These requirements are of course not reflected in the standards currently prevailing in Western academic institutions. Rather, both Bahá’í institutions and Bahá’í scholars are called on to exert a very great effort, of heart, mind, and will, in order to forge the new models of scholarly activity and guidance that Bahá’u’lláh’s work requires. The House of Justice believes that you will serve the interests of the Faith best if you will direct your thoughts to this end. Merely to reiterate the conventions and requirements of systems which, whether academic, political, social, or economic, have been shown not to have adequate answers to the anarchy now engulfing human society, or any willingness to come to grips with the implications of their impotence, is of little practical help. We do a grave disservice to both ourselves and the Faith when we simply submit to the authority of academic practices that appeal for their claim of objectivity to theories which themselves are being increasingly called into question by major thinkers. While non‑Bahá’í academics may slip carelessly into regarding the institutions founded by Bahá’u’lláh as simply another form of “religious establishment” and avoid serious examination of the truths of His Revelation in this fashion, it is clearly impossible for anyone who is a Bahá’í to follow them down this empty track.",
      "The House of Justice is aware that the continuation of the policy of review can cast a shadow on the good name of the Faith in the eyes of certain non‑Bahá’í academics. In an environment where publication is vital to advancement and recognition, any requirement that delays or inhibits this activity must be a matter of grave consideration, not only by the individual scholar but by the governing institutions of the community that eagerly watches his rise and counts anxiously on his effective assistance. But is that not precisely the kind of spiritual dilemma being faced by many Bahá’ís in their efforts to serve Bahá’u’lláh’s purpose? On many occasions, in developing lands particularly, believers of capacity have had to forgo opportunities for promising political careers, careers whose value they could easily have justified on the basis of public service, because such a choice was not in conformity with Bahá’u’lláh’s teaching and purpose. There are, likewise, many examples of believers who have had to set aside both a professional life and legitimate family concerns in order to pioneer in inhospitable regions of the globe.",
      "It is apparent that the crisis of contemporary civilisation is impelling thinkers in many lands to explore new scholarly methodologies capable of coming to grips with spiritual, moral, cultural, and social phenomena not hitherto encountered. No segment of humanity is so well equipped as the Bahá’í community to take a leading role in this effort. As a body of people who are being steadily freed by the Revelation of Bahá’u’lláh from the “gravitational pull”, so to speak, of the cultures in which their habits of mind have been formed, the community already has a unique approach to the exploration of reality. This approach needs to be sharply honed as an ever more effective instrument of social transformation. The devising of the new scholarly paradigm called for by this circumstance offers a priceless opportunity of service and achievement to those Bahá’ís who enjoy the dual gifts of spiritual faith and intellectual faculties trained in the best that contemporary society has to offer.",
      "The Universal House of Justice can only invite Bahá’í scholars, as it invites all other believers, to respond to this historic challenge, in whatever way and to whatever extent each person considers possible. It is confident that, in Bahá’í scholarship as in all other areas of Bahá’í service, the essential resources will gradually be forthcoming and the required models of research and study will be refined through the process of consultation. It is this achievement, the House of Justice believes, that in the long run will best protect the reputation of the Cause from whatever immediate misunderstandings and criticisms it may encounter. Indeed it is greatly encouraged by the response that Bahá’í scholars in many fields are already making."

      "You may be confident that the House of Justice is sympathetic to the need of Bahá’í scholars for ever‑increasing access to important Bahá’í archival sources such as the original texts of historical documents like The Dawn‑Breakers. Indeed, it is difficult to imagine how these servants of the Cause, whose contributions to its advancement and the protection of its interests are vital, will otherwise be able to discharge their role. Nor is it necessary to urge on the House of Justice the importance to the interests of the Faith of a general spirit of openness about its scriptural and historical sources.",
      "At present, the World Centre lacks the human resources, physical space, and research facilities necessary to respond adequately to this need. All of us look forward eagerly to the day when the Centre for the Study of the Texts will have come into existence in the building on the Arc designed for it and now under construction, and will be in a position to assemble the archival and research facilities which the Cause urgently requires. We are sure that if you will respond in this perspective to inquiries about access to Bahá’í primary sources you will be able largely to relieve the kinds of doubts which you describe having encountered.",
      "To propose, as some have done, that the best course in the meantime is simply to open the World Centre’s archives to visiting Bahá’í scholars who possess appropriate credentials is not realistic. Were the Archives, the Library, and the Research Department to divert energy and attention to the reception of the many researchers who would feel a legitimate right to come, their priority tasks in vital support of the work of the House of Justice, including preservation, classification, translation, annotation, and publication, would suffer to a degree that is not acceptable at this stage in the growth of the Cause. As is so often the case in many fields of research, scholars interested in work on the Faith will have to exercise a measure of patience."

      "The purpose of this letter is not to enter into a detailed examination of the activities and statements of the friends to whom you refer, or to discuss the responses they have received over the years from institutions of the Faith. Rather, the House of Justice wishes to relate this situation to certain aspects of Bahá’í belief, in the hope that thereby it may enable you to find answers to some of the questions which preoccupy your mind.",
      "At the very core of the aims of the Faith are the establishment of justice and unity in the world, the removal of prejudice and enmity from among all people, the awakening of compassion and understanding in the hearts of all men and women, and the raising of all souls to a new level of spirituality and behaviour through the vitalising influence of divine Revelation. The course set forth by Bahá’u’lláh for the attainment of these aims is the double task of simultaneously building an ideal society and perfecting the behaviour of individuals. For this dual and reciprocal transformation He has not only revealed laws, principles and truths attuned to the needs of this age, but has established the very nucleus and pattern of those institutions which are to evolve into the structure of the divinely purposed world society.",
      "Central to your perception of the statements made by the believers about whom you are concerned are their assertions that they are entirely obedient to the spirit of the Covenant and the institutions of the Faith; that they are merely voicing their disagreement with certain decisions and policies made by these institutions; are protesting against what they perceive to be unjust or improper actions by some people who occupy prominent administrative positions; and are suggesting modifications to Bahá’í procedures to prevent such perceived abuses of authority. These assertions, however, overlook certain important Bahá’í principles which provide the methods and channels for the voicing of such grievances or disagreements, and which are designed to lead to resolution of problems while preserving the unity of the community.",
      "Over many years, a few believers in the United States, instead of confining their protests against what they saw as abuses of authority by Bahá’í bodies to the channels and agencies which are plentifully provided for such a purpose, have been publicly and privily assailing the institutions of the Cause and generalising specific accusations of injustice to such an extent as to accuse the entire system of corruption, not only in practice but also in form and theory. One outcome of this continuing stream of negative criticism has been the gradual conversion of unverified accusations into accepted “facts” in the minds of some of their hearers.",
      "Through such activities, and the mutual support that they give to one another, these friends have increasingly assumed the appearance of a dissident group of Bahá’ís who are attempting to arouse widespread disaffection in the community and thereby to bring about changes in the structure and principles of Bahá’í administration, making it accord more closely with their personal notions. Such an activity is closely analogous to the pursuit of a partisan political programme, an activity which is accepted and even admired in most societies, but is entirely antithetical to the spirit of the Bahá’í Faith. It promotes an atmosphere of contention, and Bahá’u’lláh has expressly stated: “Conflict and contention are categorically forbidden in His Book.” Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh Revealed after the Kitáb‑i‑Aqdas (Wilmette: Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1995), p. 221",
      "The laws, commandments, injunctions and exhortations we have all agreed to obey and follow as Bahá’ís include a clearly defined approach to decision‑making and to the implementation of decisions. You are, undoubtedly, well familiar with the various aspects of this approach, which is built on the conviction that the path of unity is the only path that can lead to the civilisation envisioned by Bahá’u’lláh. So strong is the emphasis on unity that, for example, once a decision has been made by an Assembly, everyone is expected to support that decision wholeheartedly, relying confidently on ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá’s assurance that, even if the decision is wrong, “as it is in unity the truth will be revealed and the wrong made right”. Bahá’í World Faith: Selected Writings of Bahá’u’lláh and ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá (Wilmette: Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1976), p. 411 This principle of unity is supplemented by other, related guidelines covering such issues as how criticism can be expressed, how the wrongdoing of members of the community is to be corrected, how the principle of justice is to be applied and appeals admitted, and how the integrity of individuals, the institutions and the Cause is to be upheld.",
      "In adhering to such teachings Bahá’ís recognise that individuals do not become wholly virtuous on accepting the Faith. It takes time for them to grow spiritually out of their personal imperfections and out of the structural and behavioural assumptions of the societies in which they have been raised, which colour their view of the world. The institutions of the Cause, which the believers have been raising in obedience to the law of Bahá’u’lláh, in accordance with the pattern set forth by ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá and the expositions of Shoghi Effendi, and under the guidance of the Universal House of Justice, are still in their embryonic stage and not infrequently fall short of the ideal for which they are striving. There is also the possibility of certain individuals’ misusing the positions of authority to which they are elected or appointed within the structure of the Administrative Order. Again and again Shoghi Effendi, in his letters, called upon the Bahá’ís to be patient and forbearing, both with one another and with their Assemblies, but in serious cases of malfunctioning by either institutions or individuals, neither the Guardian nor the Universal House of Justice has hesitated to take remedial action. Bahá’í Administration has provisions to cope with such human frailties and is designed to enable the believers to build Bahá’u’lláh’s new World Order in the midst of their imperfections, but without conflicts which would destroy the entire edifice.",
      "One of the tasks of the Universal House of Justice, in addition to enacting legislation, resolving difficult problems, elucidating obscure matters, settling differences, administering the worldwide affairs of the Cause and directing the course of the implementation of the Divine Plan, is to protect the individual believers and the body of the Cause from the deleterious effects of malfunctioning institutions and unwise or malicious individuals. Most of the time these defects, whether in the behaviour of individuals or institutions, are of a relatively minor nature and can be dealt with by the Local and National Assemblies or by the Counsellors with the members of the Auxiliary Boards and their assistants. However, at times the situation becomes far more grave and the World Centre is compelled to intervene.",
      "You are most directly concerned with the situation in the United States. The letter of 19 May 1994 does, indeed, address certain aspects of the functioning of your National Spiritual Assembly—it was, after all, written in response to the National Assembly’s request for guidance—but that is merely one of the issues before the American Bahá’í community. If you study that letter carefully you will see that it calls for a range of improvements in the actions of the individual believers and the entire community. Indeed it develops points touched on in the letter of 29 December 1988 which urges the believers to rethink accepted theories of the functioning of society.",
      "Sadly, efforts made by the institutions and some of their fellow believers to explain these issues seem to have been dismissed by the friends previously referred to. A few politely acknowledged the communications of the House of Justice, but then continued on their way, ignoring the fundamental points which had been made. A few have openly opposed the House of Justice’s guidance. The rhetoric has become far removed from a pure concern to uphold justice and the rights of individuals within the community; it has developed into the fomentation of contention about some of the most fundamental beliefs of the Faith and an attack on the basis of the Covenant which, alone, is the ultimate guarantee that the Faith will remain true to its divine origin throughout the centuries.",
      "The point at issue has thus become that of whether believers should be permitted to continue indefinitely to undermine the faith of their fellow Bahá’ís, stir up agitation within the community, and publicly assail the theory as well as the practice of Bahá’u’lláh’s Administrative Order.",
      "In the Kitáb‑i‑Aqdas Bahá’u’lláh states: “We approve of liberty in certain circumstances, and refuse to sanction it in others.” The Kitáb‑i‑Aqdas: The Most Holy Book (Wilmette: Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1993), par. 124 One area in which liberty is limited in the Bahá’í community is that governing methods and channels for the expression of criticism. In this connection, we enclose a brief compilation of excerpts from letters written on behalf of Shoghi Effendi to individual believers. From this guidance, the following principles can be clearly derived:",
      "The importance of unity as both the goal of Bahá’u’lláh’s Message and the means for its establishment. Bahá’u’lláh “has not only advocated certain principles, but has also provided a mechanism whereby that ideal can be established and perpetuated”, adherence to both of which by the friends is essential for “the realisation of His goal of world unity”.",
      "Bahá’ís are “fully entitled to address criticisms to their Assemblies” and offer their recommendations. When Bahá’ís have addressed their criticisms, suggestions and advice to their Assemblies, including their views “about policies or individual members of elected bodies”, they must “whole‑heartedly accept the advice or decision of the Assembly”.",
      "There is a clear distinction between, on the one hand, the prohibition of backbiting, which would include adverse comments about individuals or institutions made to other individuals privately or publicly, and, on the other hand, the encouragement to unburden oneself of one’s concerns to a Spiritual Assembly, Local or National (or now, also, to confide in a Counsellor or Auxiliary Board member). Thus, although one of the principal functions of the Nineteen Day Feast is to provide a forum for “open and constructive criticism and deliberation regarding the state of affairs within the local Bahá’í community”, complaints about the actions of an individual member of an Assembly should be made directly and confidentially to the Assembly itself, not made to other individuals or even raised at a Nineteen Day Feast.",
      "While constructive criticism is encouraged, destructive criticism, such as the pattern of “continually challenging and criticising the decisions” of the Assemblies, prevents the rapid growth of the Faith and repels those who are yet outside the community. Indeed “all criticisms and discussions of a negative character which may result in undermining the authority of the Assembly as a body should be strictly avoided. For otherwise the order of the Cause itself will be endangered, and confusion and discord will reign in the community.” “Vicious criticism is indeed a calamity”, the root of which is “lack of faith in the system of Bahá’u’lláh” and failure to follow the “Bahá’í laws in voting, in electing, in serving, and in abiding by Assembly decisions”.",
      "The questions of how criticism is expressed and acted upon in the Bahá’í community, and how the Spiritual Assemblies administer justice in regard to individual believers, are but elements of far greater concepts and should become second nature in the social discourse of Bahá’ís. The Bahá’í community is an association of individuals who have voluntarily come together, on recognising Bahá’u’lláh’s claim to be the Manifestation of God for this age, to establish certain patterns of personal and social behaviour and to build the institutions that are to promote these patterns. There are numerous individuals who share the ideals of the Faith and draw inspiration from its Teachings, while disagreeing with certain of its features, but those who actually enter the Bahá’í community have accepted, by their own free will, to follow the Teachings in their entirety, understanding that, if doubts and disagreements arise in the process of translating the Teachings into practice, the final arbiter is, by the explicit authority of the Revealed Text, the Universal House of Justice.",
      "It is the ardent prayer of the Universal House of Justice that any friends who find themselves at odds in this endeavour will have confidence in the guidance it provides for them, will renew their study of the Teachings and, for the sake of Bahá’u’lláh, strengthen their love for one another. As the beloved Guardian’s secretary wrote on his behalf to an individual believer on 25 October 1949: “Without the spirit of real love for Bahá’u’lláh, for His Faith and its Institutions, and the believers for each other, the Cause can never really bring in large numbers of people. For it is not preaching and rules the world wants, but love and action.” The worldwide undertakings on which the Cause of God is embarked are far too significant, the need of the peoples of the world for the Message of Bahá’u’lláh far too urgent, the perils facing mankind far too grave, the progress of events far too swift, to permit His followers to squander their time and efforts in fruitless contention. Now, if ever, is the time for love among the friends, for unity of understanding and endeavour, for self‑sacrifice and service by Bahá’ís in every part of the world.",
      "The House of Justice understands and appreciates your concern for the proper functioning of the Bahá’í community. It urges you to contemplate the issues you have raised in the light of the Teachings themselves, and not to weigh them with the standards of other philosophies or of any civil system, the fundamental assumptions of which differ in many respects from those of Bahá’u’lláh’s divinely conceived Order."

      "The questions you pose, arising out of an email conversation between yourself and one of the other contributors to the discussion group in which you participate, are of fundamental importance, and the House of Justice warmly appreciates the spirit of your inquiry.",
      "The issues raised seem to resolve themselves into two points: the first being whether or not the Universal House of Justice has the authority to make authoritative interpretations; the second is whether anyone has the right to challenge the authority or actions of the Universal House of Justice. When these issues are approached with an understanding of the unity underlying all the Teachings, clarification results. Should the seeker, however, be influenced by a spirit of mistrust and conflict, then unending problems appear.",
      "The above points have both been covered in three letters written by the Universal House of Justice on 9 March 1965, 27 May 1966 and 7 December 1969. Unfortunately it seems that many of the friends have not studied these letters deeply or understood their implications. Already in The Dispensation of Bahá’u’lláh Shoghi Effendi has shown, beyond any doubt, that the function of making authoritative interpretations of the Teachings is confined solely and exclusively to the Guardian. Neither the Universal House of Justice, nor any other institution, person or group of persons can assume that function. That the Universal House of Justice will never infringe on the functions reserved to the Guardian is shown, not only by its own words and actions, but by Shoghi Effendi’s statement in that same document: “Neither can, nor will ever, infringe upon the sacred and prescribed domain of the other.” It is guaranteed by the fact that the Universal House of Justice as well as the Guardian are both “under the care and protection of the Abhá Beauty, under the shelter and unerring guidance of His Holiness, the Exalted One”.",
      "In its letter of 9 March 1965, the House of Justice has stated: “There is a profound difference between the interpretations of the Guardian and the elucidations of the House of Justice in exercise of its function to ‘deliberate upon all problems which have caused difference, questions that are obscure, and matters that are not expressly recorded in the Book.’” The friends will come to understand what this difference is by observing how the House of Justice functions and by turning to it for explanations when necessary.",
      "As you recognise, the authority of the Universal House of Justice is unchallengeable. This is stated in numerous places in the Writings. In the same passage of the Will and Testament quoted above, ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá goes on to say of the Guardian and the Universal House of Justice: “Whatsoever they decide is of God. Whoso obeyeth him not, neither obeyeth them, hath not obeyed God; whoso rebelleth against him and against them hath rebelled against God; whoso opposeth him hath opposed God; whoso contendeth with them hath contended with God; whoso disputeth with him hath disputed with God; whoso denieth him hath denied God; whoso disbelieveth in him hath disbelieved in God; whoso deviateth, separateth himself, and turneth aside from him hath in truth deviated, separated himself and turned aside from God.”",
      "Furthermore, at the very end of the Will and Testament, in warning against the danger of Covenant‑breaking, ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá wrote: “Beware lest anyone falsely interpret these words, and like unto them that have broken the Covenant after the Day of Ascension (of Bahá’u’lláh) advance a pretext, raise the standard of revolt, wax stubborn, and open wide the door of false interpretation.” In this context, He continues: “To none is given the right to put forth his own opinion or express his particular conviction. All must seek guidance and turn unto the Centre of the Cause and the House of Justice. And he that turneth unto whatsoever else is indeed in grievous error.”",
      "It is natural that the friends would discuss such matters among themselves, as you and your correspondent have been doing on your Internet discussion group; how otherwise are they to deepen their understanding of the Teachings? But they should recognise that the resolution of differences of opinion on such fundamental questions is not to be found by continued discussion, but in referring to the Universal House of Justice itself, as you have done. Prolonged, unresolved, public discussion of these fundamental questions can do nothing but breed confusion and dissension.",
      "Some people have put forward the thesis that in place of the Guardian’s function of authoritative interpretation, a check on the Universal House of Justice should be set up, either in the form of the general opinion of the mass of the believers, or in the form of a body of learned Bahá’ís—preferably those with academic qualifications. The former is in direct contradiction to the Guardian’s statement that the members of the Universal House of Justice are not “allowed to be governed by the feelings, the general opinion, and even the convictions of the mass of the faithful, or of those who directly elect them.” “They are to follow”, he writes, “the dictates and promptings of their conscience. They may, indeed they must, acquaint themselves with the conditions prevailing among the community, must weigh dispassionately in their minds the merits of any case presented for their consideration, but must reserve for themselves the right of an unfettered decision. ‘God will verily inspire them with whatsoever He willeth,’ is Bahá’u’lláh’s incontrovertible assurance.” As to the latter alternative: this would constitute usurpation of a function of the Guardian.",
      "Scholarship has a high rank in the Cause of God, and the Universal House of Justice continually consults the views of scholars and experts in the course of its work. However, as you appreciate, scholars and experts have no authority over the Institutions of the Cause. In a letter written on behalf of the Guardian, on 14 March 1927, to the Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís of Istanbul, it is pointed out how, in the past, it was certain individuals who “accounted themselves as superior in knowledge and elevated in position” who caused division, and that it was those “who pretended to be the most distinguished of all” who “always proved themselves to be the source of contention.” “But praise be to God” he continued, “that the Pen of Glory has done away with the unyielding and dictatorial views of the learned and the wise, dismissed the assertions of individuals as an authoritative criterion, even though they were recognised as the most accomplished and learned among men and ordained that all matters be referred to authorised centres and specified assemblies. Even so, no assembly has been invested with the absolute authority to deal with such general matters as affect the interests of nations. Nay, rather, He has brought all the assemblies together under the shadow of the one House of Justice, one divinely‑appointed Centre, so that there would be only one Centre and all the rest integrated into a single body, revolving around one expressly‑designated Pivot, thus making them all proof against schism and division.”",
      "Comments have been made in recent times, implying the existence of two categories of believers, designated “administrators” and “academics”. The House of Justice feels that it is important to recognise the unsoundness of such a concept. In the nature of Bahá’í administration, there is no class of believers who serve as “administrators”. Individual Bahá’ís are either elected or appointed to positions of administrative service; they come from every field of endeavour, including academia. There is, moreover, a natural flow of individuals into and out of administrative posts. The same applies to the occupants of those institutions of the Administrative Order which are referred to as being of the “learned” in the Faith. Clearly there are some Bahá’ís who are “academics” and some who are not, but “academics” in no way constitute a recognised group in relation to the structure of the Cause.",
      "There remains the question concerning the authority for the duties and responsibilities outlined for the Universal House of Justice in its constitution. These provisions are a codification of explicit statements found in the sacred texts and the writings of Shoghi Effendi.",
      "The House of Justice assures you of its prayers in the Holy Shrines that your efforts to assist the friends to overcome misunderstandings and to clarify their vision of the Faith will be blessed with divine confirmations."

      "The candour with which you have expressed your views is much appreciated, as is the earnestness of your desire to see the Bahá’í community overcome a situation which is unhealthy in itself and risks creating misunderstanding in segments of the academic community. The House of Justice is, of course, aware that problems have arisen in this area, and it welcomes the opportunity to acquaint you with its thinking and perspectives. Having considered these, you should feel encouraged to respond with any related suggestions you think might assist in relieving the stresses you perceive.",
      "The House of Justice believes that it will be helpful to set the problem in the context of the current intellectual and spiritual crisis afflicting society at large. Scholarly training and professional experience will have sensitised you to the implications for the study of religion of certain assumptions about human nature and the processes of civilisation that a purely materialistic interpretation of reality has imposed on scholarly activity of every kind, at least in the Western world. A related paradigm for the study of religion has gradually consolidated itself in the prevailing academic culture during the course of the present century. It insists that all spiritual and moral phenomena must be understood through the application of a scholarly apparatus devised to explore existence in a way that ignores the issues of God’s continuous relationship with His creation and His intervention in human life and history. Yet, from a Bahá’í point of view, it is precisely this intervention that is the central theme of the Teachings of the Founders of the revealed religions ostensibly being studied.",
      "As a result of this insistence, opinions that should have remained matters of learned speculation have tended to assume the character of dogma. Equally regrettable is an intolerant attitude toward other perceptions of reality, which too often characterises the expression of these opinions. In the context of historical circumstance, this development is understandable. The rigid intolerance exhibited in the past by much of organised religion, together with the domination of scholarship long exercised by theological elites, could not but arouse strong negative reactions. From a Bahá’í point of view, however, bigotry is retrograde and unacceptable in whatever form it chooses to present itself.",
      "Such conditions would not normally be a matter for comment; they represent only a few among the host of less than encouraging circumstances in which the Cause must carry out its work. Devotion to learning has been an integral feature of Bahá’í life and belief from the beginning. It ensures that the community will not be deterred by shortcomings in any of the traditions of scholarship from according these traditions the full respect they merit or from seeking to benefit to the utmost from such endeavours.",
      "Problems will arise, rather, if an attempt is made to impose, on the Bahá’í community’s own study of the Revelation, materialistic methodologies and attitudes antithetical to its very nature. The Faith is not the possession of any among us, but belongs to Bahá’u’lláh. Through the Covenant, which is a distinguishing feature of His Revelation, He has specified in unmistakable terms the means by which He wills to preserve the integrity of His message and to guide the implementation of His prescriptions for humankind. If one accepts the Bahá’í Teachings, one cannot, in good conscience, claim to be studying the Faith while ignoring the centrality of Bahá’u’lláh’s Covenant to all aspects of the religion He has established.",
      "It is in this context that the House of Justice believes that the concerns expressed in your letter must be addressed. There may well be Bahá’ís who, whatever their educational background, have not yet fully resolved for themselves the fundamental issues touched on in the foregoing. Where this happens, an individual risks finding himself or herself at odds not only with the institutions of the Cause, including the Universal House of Justice itself, but with the clear interpretations of the Teachings by the Master and the Guardian. In such cases, Counsellors and Spiritual Assemblies will certainly do all they can to help. Knowledgeable believers like yourself can also be of great assistance, but belief, for Bahá’ís, is a matter of personal conscience. Should a person conclude that he or she cannot persist in a commitment to the Cause, such a decision is respected by the Bahá’í community.",
      "It is not out of a desire to take issue with the views you have expressed, but rather in an attempt to respond frankly to your concerns, that the House of Justice has asked us to convey its comments on a number of points where its perceptions differ from those you have presented. These relate chiefly to the behaviour of a very small group of Bahá’ís who, rejecting all efforts of the administrative institutions to counsel and appeal to them, have aggressively sought to promote their misconceptions of the Teachings among their fellow believers. These efforts extend back many years, harnessing to their purpose a wide range of Bahá’í activities and associations, most recently Internet lists.",
      "Such activities have not been limited to interference with the administration of the affairs of the Bahá’í community, although they have, as you note, included such interference. A far greater problem has been the persistent effort to arouse doubts about the integrity of the Teachings, as interpreted for us by ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá and the Guardian, to undermine the authority of the Faith’s institutions, and to alter the essential nature of Bahá’u’lláh’s message. Seizing on apparently unwise interventions on the part of a few Bahá’ís of rigid mind‑set, this campaign has boldly sought to exclude from consideration the implications of the Covenant for the discussions taking place.",
      "These efforts have been accompanied by a deliberate attempt to misrepresent the institutions of the Faith as repressive of learning and to introduce into a Bahá’í discourse a fevered debate on individual rights, borrowed from the political environment. You can yourself testify that not only are Bahá’ís urged to uphold the principle of unfettered search after truth, but they have also been encouraged from the time of the Faith’s inception to pursue knowledge in all its forms and to excel in such attainments. If one is sincere in a concern for the Bahá’í community’s intellectual advancement, one will not compromise scholarship by entangling it in private, ideological objectives which undermine its influence.",
      "You will want also to take into careful account the fact that the individuals seeking to generate these controversies, although vociferous, are in no way representative of the opinions of the great majority of Bahá’ís with academic and other scholarly qualifications. Indeed, a sad feature of discussions on one or two Internet lists, which has been brought to the attention of the House of Justice, has been the number of academically well‑qualified believers who have eventually been driven to give up an interchange of ideas that could have been extremely fruitful by what they perceived as merely the relentless pursuit of a partisan agenda.",
      "The House of Justice urges you to reflect deeply on the reasons why those pursuing this agenda seek by every means possible to represent their actions as a disinterested search for knowledge and themselves as victims of authoritarianism. The principle which should guide our efforts to share the fruits of Bahá’í scholarship has been made clear for all of us in this passage from Bahá’u’lláh’s Writings:",
      "Thou hast written that one of the friends hath composed a treatise. This was mentioned in the Holy Presence, and this is what was revealed in response: Great care should be exercised that whatever is written in these days doth not cause dissension, and invite the objection of the people. Whatever the friends of the one true God say in these days is listened to by the people of the world. It hath been revealed in the Lawḥ‑i‑Hikmat: “The unbelievers have inclined their ears towards Us in order to hear that which might enable them to cavil against God, the Help in Peril, the Self‑Subsisting.” Whatever is written should not transgress the bounds of tact and wisdom, and in the words used there should lie hid the property of milk, so that the children of the world may be nurtured therewith, and attain maturity. We have said in the past that one word hath the influence of spring and causeth hearts to become fresh and verdant, while another is like unto blight which causeth the blossoms and flowers to wither. God grant that authors among the friends will write in such a way as would be acceptable to fair‑minded souls, and not lead to cavilling by the people.",
      "Not surprisingly, the abuse of Internet discussions on the Faith and its Teachings has had the effect of greatly distressing friends who became aware of it. That the response has included, as your letter suggests, a degree of intemperate criticism, inappropriate comment and unjust accusation is lamentable, but also not surprising, for contentiousness begets contention. You should be confident that the House of Justice will not permit a climate of intolerance to prosper in the Bahá’í community, no matter from what cause it arises. Further, the House of Justice will continue to encourage use of the greatly expanded opportunities for the discussion of Bahá’í concepts and ideals, which Internet communication so marvellously provides.",
      "Finally, it is no doubt helpful to keep in mind that Bahá’ís who are trained in various academic disciplines do not constitute a discrete body within the community. While the Bahá’í institutions benefit on an ongoing basis from the advice of believers in many fields of specialisation, there is obviously no group of academics who can claim to speak on behalf of Bahá’í scholars generally. Scholarly qualifications enable individuals to make greatly valued contributions to the work of the Cause, but do not set those possessing them apart from the general body of the believers. The House of Justice feels confident that, with patience, self‑discipline, and unity of faith, Bahá’í academics will be able to contribute to a gradual forging of the more integrative paradigms of scholarship for which thoughtful minds in the international community are increasingly calling."

      "Your email of . . . covers a number of issues, the first of which relates to methods followed in researching, understanding and writing about historical events, and the elements of these methods which the House of Justice regards as being influenced by materialism. The purpose of scholarship in such fields should obviously be the ascertainment of truth, and Bahá’í scholars should, of course, observe the highest standards of honesty, integrity and truthfulness. Moreover, the House of Justice accepts that many scholarly methods have been developed which are soundly based and of enduring validity. It nevertheless questions some presumptions of certain current academic methods because it sees these producing a distorted picture of reality.",
      "The training of some scholars in fields such as religion and history seems to have restricted their vision and blinded them to the culturally determined basis of elements of the approach they have learned. It causes them to exclude from consideration factors which, from a Bahá’í point of view, are of fundamental importance. Truth in such fields cannot be found if the evidence of Revelation is systematically excluded and if discourse is limited by a basically deterministic view of the world.",
      "Some of the protagonists in the discussions on the Internet have implied that the only way to attain a true understanding of historical events and of the purport of the sacred and historical records of the Cause of God is through the rigid application of methods narrowly defined in a materialistic framework. They have even gone so far as to stigmatise whoever proposes a variation of these methods as wishing to obscure the truth rather than unveil it.",
      "The House of Justice recognises that, at the other extreme, there are Bahá’ís who, imbued by what they conceive to be loyalty to Bahá’u’lláh, cling to blind acceptance of what they understand to be a statement of the Sacred Text. This shortcoming demonstrates an equally serious failure to grasp the profundity of the Bahá’í principle of the harmony of faith and reason. The danger of such an attitude is that it exalts personal understanding of some part of the Revelation over the whole, leads to illogical and internally inconsistent applications of the Sacred Text, and provides fuel to those who would mistakenly characterise loyalty to the Covenant as “fundamentalism”.",
      "It is not surprising that individual Bahá’ís hold and express different and sometimes defective understandings of the Teachings; this is but an evidence of the magnitude of the change that this Revelation is to effect in human consciousness. As believers with various insights into the Teachings converse—with patience, tolerance and open and unbiased minds —a deepening of comprehension should take place. The strident insistence on individual views, however, can lead to contention, which is detrimental not only to the spirit of Bahá’í association and collaboration but to the search for truth itself.",
      "Beyond contention, moreover, is the condition in which a person is so immovably attached to one erroneous viewpoint that his insistence upon it amounts to an effort to change the essential character of the Faith. This kind of behaviour, if permitted to continue unchecked, could produce disruption in the Bahá’í community, giving birth to countless sects as it has done in previous Dispensations. The Covenant of Bahá’u’lláh prevents this. The Faith defines elements of a code of conduct, and it is ultimately the responsibility of the Universal House of Justice, in watching over the security of the Cause and upholding the integrity of its Teachings, to require the friends to adhere to standards thus defined.",
      "The Universal House of Justice does not see itself obliged to prescribe a new scientific methodology for Bahá’í academics who make study of the Faith, its teachings and history the subject of their professional activities. Rather has it concentrated on drawing the attention of these friends to the inadequacy of certain approaches from a Bahá’í point of view, urging them to apply to their work the concept which they accept as Bahá’ís: that the Manifestation of God is of a higher realm and has a perception far above that of any human being. He has the task of raising humankind to a new level of knowledge and behaviour. In this, His understanding transcends the traditions and concepts of the society in which He appears. As Bahá’u’lláh Himself writes in the Hidden Words:",
      "O Son of Beauty! By My spirit and by My favour! By My mercy and by My beauty! All that I have revealed unto thee with the tongue of power, and have written for thee with the pen of might, hath been in accordance with thy capacity and understanding, not with My state and the melody of My voice.",
      "Although, in conveying His Revelation, the Manifestation uses the language and culture of the country into which He is born, He is not confined to using terminology with the same connotations as those given to it by His predecessors or contemporaries; He delivers His message in a form which His audience, both immediate and in centuries to come, is capable of grasping. It is for Bahá’í scholars to elaborate, over a period of time, methodologies which will enable them to perform their work with this understanding. This is a challenging task, but not one which should be beyond the scope of Bahá’ís who are learned in the Teachings as well as competent in their scientific disciplines.",
      "This brings us to the specific points raised in your email of 17 November 1997. As you well understand, not only the right but also the responsibility of each believer to explore truth for himself or herself are fundamental to the Bahá’í teachings. This principle is an integral feature of the coming of age of humankind, inseparable from the social transformation to which Bahá’u’lláh is calling the peoples of the world. It is as relevant to specifically scholarly activity as it is to the rest of spiritual and intellectual life. Every human being is ultimately responsible to God for the use which he or she makes of these possibilities; conscience is never to be coerced, whether by other individuals or institutions.",
      "Conscience, however, is not an unchangeable absolute. One dictionary definition, although not covering all the usages of the term, presents the common understanding of the word “conscience” as “the sense of right and wrong as regards things for which one is responsible; the faculty or principle which pronounces upon the moral quality of one’s actions or motives, approving the right and condemning the wrong”.",
      "The functioning of one’s conscience, then, depends upon one’s understanding of right and wrong; the conscience of one person may be established upon a disinterested striving after truth and justice, while that of another may rest on an unthinking predisposition to act in accordance with that pattern of standards, principles and prohibitions which is a product of his social environment. Conscience, therefore, can serve either as a bulwark of an upright character or can represent an accumulation of prejudices learned from one’s forebears or absorbed from a limited social code.",
      "A Bahá’í recognises that one aspect of his spiritual and intellectual growth is to foster the development of his conscience in the light of divine Revelation—a Revelation which, in addition to providing a wealth of spiritual and ethical principles, exhorts man “to free himself from idle fancy and imitation, discern with the eye of oneness His glorious handiwork, and look into all things with a searching eye”. This process of development, therefore, involves a clear‑sighted examination of the conditions of the world with both heart and mind. A Bahá’í will understand that an upright life is based upon observance of certain principles which stem from Divine Revelation and which he recognises as essential for the well‑being of both the individual and society. In order to uphold such principles, he knows that, in certain cases, the voluntary submission of the promptings of his own personal conscience to the decision of the majority is a conscientious requirement, as in wholeheartedly accepting the majority decision of an Assembly at the outcome of consultation.",
      "In the discussion of wisdom in your email of 21 September 1997, you observe that maybe “Bahá’í academics all too often have not recognised that to a great extent failure to exercise wisdom represents a failure of love.” The House of Justice agrees that the exercise of wisdom calls for a measure of love and the development of a sensitive conscience. These, in turn, involve not only devotion to a high standard of uprightness, but also consideration of the effects of one’s words and actions.",
      "A Bahá’í’s duty to pursue an unfettered search after truth should lead him to understand the Teachings as an organic, logically coherent whole, should cause him to examine his own ideas and motives, and should enable him to see that adherence to the Covenant, to which he is a party, is not blind imitation but conscious choice, freely made and freely followed.",
      "In many of His utterances, ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá extols governments which uphold freedom of conscience for their citizens. As can be seen from the context, these statements refer to the freedom to follow the religion of one’s choice. In the original of a passage to which you refer in your email of . . . , He gives the following analysis of freedom.",
      "There are three types of freedom. The first is divine freedom, which is one of the inherent attributes of the Creator for He is unconstrained in His will, and no one can force Him to change His decree in any matter whatsoever. . . .",
      "The second is the political freedom of Europeans, which leaves the individual free to do whatsoever he desires as long as his action does not harm his neighbour. This is natural freedom, and its greatest expression is seen in the animal world. Observe these birds and notice with what freedom they live. However much man may try, he can never be as free as an animal, because the existence of order acts as an impediment to freedom.",
      "The third freedom is that which is born of obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Almighty. This is the freedom of the human world, where man severs his affections from all things. When he does so, he becomes immune to all hardship and sorrow. Wealth or material power will not deflect him from moderation and fairness, neither will poverty or need inhibit him from showing forth happiness and tranquillity. The more the conscience of man develops, the more will his heart be free and his soul attain unto happiness. In the religion of God, there is freedom of thought because God, alone, controls the human conscience, but this freedom should not go beyond courtesy. In the religion of God, there is no freedom of action outside the law of God. Man may not transgress this law, even though no harm is inflicted on one’s neighbour. This is because the purpose of Divine law is the education of all—others as well as oneself—and, in the sight of God, the harm done to one individual or to his neighbour is the same and is reprehensible in both cases. Hearts must possess the fear of God. Man should endeavour to avoid that which is abhorrent unto God. Therefore, the freedom that the laws of Europe offer to the individual does not exist in the law of God. Freedom of thought should not transgress the bounds of courtesy, and actions, likewise, should be governed by the fear of God and the desire to seek His good pleasure.",
      "Education of the individual Bahá’í in the Divine law is one of the duties of Spiritual Assemblies. In a letter to a National Assembly on 1 March 1951, Shoghi Effendi wrote:",
      "The deepening and enrichment of the spiritual life of the individual believer, his increasing comprehension of the essential verities underlying this Faith, his training in its administrative processes, his understanding of the fundamentals of the Covenants established by its Author and the authorised Interpreter of its teachings, should be made the supreme objectives of the national representatives responsible for the edification, the progress and consolidation of these communities.",
      "Such is the duty resting on the elected institutions of the Faith for the promotion of the spiritual, moral and ethical lives of the individual believers. Parallel with this, the Bahá’í Faith upholds the freedom of conscience which permits a person to follow his chosen religion: no one may be compelled to become a Bahá’í, or to remain a Bahá’í if he conscientiously wishes to leave the Faith. As to the thoughts of the Bahá’ís themselves—that is those who have chosen to follow the religion of Bahá’u’lláh—the institutions do not busy themselves with what individual believers think unless those thoughts become expressed in actions which are inimical to the basic principles and vital interests of the Faith.",
      "With regard to the accusation that to make such distinctions borders on restriction of the freedom of speech, one should accept that civil society has long recognised that utterance can metamorphose into behaviour, and has taken steps to protect itself and its citizens against such behaviour when it becomes socially destructive. Laws against sedition and hate‑mongering are examples that come readily to mind.",
      "It will surely be clear to you from the above comments that the categories of “issues of doctrinal heresy which must therefore be suppressed” and “the imposition of orthodoxy on the Bahá’í community”, to which you refer, are concepts essentially drawn from the study of Christianity and are inapplicable to the far more complex interrelationships and principles established by the Bahá’í Faith.",
      "It is important for all those Bahá’ís who are engaged in the academic study of the Bahá’í Faith to address the theoretical problems which undoubtedly exist, while refusing to be distracted by insidious and unscholarly attacks and calumnies which may periodically be injected into their discussions by the ill‑intentioned. Discussion with those who sincerely raise problematic issues, whether they be Bahá’ís or not, and whether—if the latter—they disagree with Bahá’í teachings, can be beneficial and enlightening. However, to continue dialogue with those who have shown a fixed antagonism to the Faith, and have demonstrated their imperviousness to any ideas other than their own, is usually fruitless and, for the Bahá’ís who take part, can be burdensome and even spiritually corrosive.",
      "The problem which aroused the concern of the House of Justice, and has been the subject of a number of communications, was the systematic corruption of Bahá’í discourse in certain of the Internet discussion groups, a design which became increasingly apparent to many of the Bahá’í participants and whose first victim, if it were to succeed, would be Bahá’í scholarship itself. The element which exacerbated a dispute which had been simmering during the past two decades and erupted on the Internet was the participation of some persons who, while nominally Bahá’ís, cherished their own programmes and designed to make use of the Bahá’í Cause for the advancement of these programmes. To this end they strove to change the essential characteristics of that Cause. This behaviour has been abundantly confirmed by statements made and actions taken by certain of the involved individuals since they withdrew from the Bahá’í community. They sought to use the language, the occasions and the credibility of scholarly activity to lend a counterfeit authority to a private enterprise which was essentially ideological in nature and self‑motivated in origin. Even if their original aims were idealistic in nature—no matter how ill‑informed and erroneous in concept—they had evolved in practice into an assault on the Covenant which Bahá’u’lláh has created as a stronghold within which His Cause would evolve as He intends. The purpose of some of those responsible would seem to be that, by diminishing the station of Bahá’u’lláh—a disservice done to previous Manifestations by people similarly inclined—by casting doubt on the authority conferred on ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá, the Guardian and the Universal House of Justice, and by calling into question the integrity of Bahá’í administrative processes, they would be able to persuade a number of unwary followers that the Bahá’í Faith is in fact not a Divine Revelation but a kind of socio‑political system being manipulated by ambitious individuals.",
      "Your own familiarity with these same persons’ behaviour will have provided you with ample illustration of the violence being done by their public and private statements to Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings, which they profess to honour, and to the cause of scholarship, which they profess to serve. We cannot separate method from spirit and character. In The Secret of Divine Civilisation, ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá gives the standard for the “spiritually learned” whom He describes as “skilled physicians for the ailing body of the world” and “the sure antidote to the poison that has corrupted human society”:",
      "For every thing, however, God has created a sign and symbol, and established standards and tests by which it may be known. The spiritually learned must be characterised by both inward and outward perfections; they must possess a good character, an enlightened nature, a pure intent, as well as intellectual power, brilliance and discernment, intuition, discretion and foresight, temperance, reverence, and a heartfelt fear of God. For an unlit candle, however great in diameter and tall, is no better than a barren palm tree or a pile of dead wood."

      "We have been asked by the Universal House of Justice to respond on its behalf to your email letter of 9 August 2002. Your description of the lack of significant numerical growth in Bahá’í communities in Western lands, while more precisely applicable to some countries than others, is largely accurate, and the resulting distress you feel is fully justified. To see important Bahá’í communities markedly lacking in the development of the human resources required to reach populations desperately searching for solutions to the crisis in which society is sinking is painful indeed to believers aware of the potency of Bahá’u’lláh’s Message.",
      "This consideration was an important element in the drafting of the relevant sections of the document “Century of Light”, to which you make reference. These passages of the document seek to acquaint believers everywhere with the profound change in Bahá’í culture that the preceding decades of struggle, achievement and disappointment made possible and that was capitalised on through the agency of the Four Year Plan. The culture now emerging is one in which groups of Bahá’u’lláh’s followers explore together the truths in His Teachings, freely open their study circles, devotional gatherings and children’s classes to their friends and neighbours, and invest their efforts confidently in plans of action designed at the level of the cluster, that makes growth a manageable goal. The enthusiasm with which Bahá’í communities in most parts of the world are responding to this challenge, and the results their efforts are beginning to garner have been a source of great joy to the House of Justice.",
      "Alas, this level of response still falls short of being universal. Where Bahá’í communities are unable to free themselves from an orientation to Bahá’í life that has long outlived whatever value it once possessed, the teaching work will lack both the systematic character it requires, and the spirit that must animate all effective service to the Cause. To mistakenly identify Bahá’í community life with the mode of religious activity that characterises the general society—in which the believer is a member of a congregation, leadership comes from an individual or individuals presumed to be qualified for the purpose, and personal participation is fitted into a schedule dominated by concerns of a very different nature—can only have the effect of marginalising the Faith and robbing the community of the spiritual vitality available to it.",
      "As you are certainly aware, the Four Year Plan, the Twelve Month Plan and the current Five Year Plan have been designed as progressive steps in achieving this change of Bahá’í culture. For their part, the Continental Boards of Counsellors around the world have been intensely engaged in assisting National and Local Spiritual Assemblies, Regional Councils and other administrative bodies to understand the goals involved and to devise strategies for their achievement. Large‑scale consultative sessions that have brought together the members of all of these key institutions have, in most cases, been particularly successful in achieving this objective. Where response has lagged, the House of Justice frequently has intervened to reinforce the efforts of the Counsellors by clarifying issues. Ultimately, the responsibility for ensuring that their own community arises to the challenge must rest with the elected representatives of the believers, at local and national levels.",
      "The advancement of the Cause is an evolutionary process which takes place through trial and error, through reflection on experience and through wholehearted commitment to the teaching Plans and strategies devised by the House of Justice. Believers, like yourself, who appreciate the opportunities thus provided, can be of great assistance by encouraging their respective countries and assemblies to similarly invest themselves in the process.",
      "The House of Justice was deeply touched by the spirit that moved you to write, and assures you of its prayers in the Holy Shrines, that Bahá’u’lláh may bless and confirm your efforts to serve His Cause.",

      "The community of the Most Great Name the world over is filled with excitement and joy as a result of the launching of the new Five Year Plan. The loving messages of the delegates of the various National Conventions to the Bahá’í World Centre speak of the determination of the Bahá’ís everywhere to accelerate the process of entry by troops through the launching of intensive programmes of growth in no less than 1,500 clusters around the world. Many of these messages contained the joyful and soul‑stirring news that the account of the steadfastness of the believers in Írán in the face of the current oppression and their faithfulness to the divine Teachings have assisted in creating a spiritual atmosphere in those gatherings. The messages received also indicate that your self‑sacrifices in promoting the interests of the Faith under the current difficult conditions are a shining example of sacrifice, a source of spiritual strength and an effective means of encouragement for other lovers of Bahá’u’lláh in the uttermost corners of the world, making them more determined in their efforts to teach the Faith and serve the Cause. Note how the forces emanating from the forbearance of the dear Bahá’ís in Írán in these calamitous days have further clarified the meaning of the statement “Should they attempt to conceal its light on the continent it will assuredly rear its head in the midmost heart of the ocean and, raising its voice, proclaim: “I am the life‑giver of the world!” and prepared the means for its material advancement. In this regard, recalling the divine promise made by the pen of the Blessed Beauty in reference to the persecutions inflicted on the Manifestation of God Himself is a source of upliftment to the soul. He states,",
      "For now, however, they have hidden Me behind a veil of darkness, whose fabric they have woven with the hands of idle fancy and vain imagination. Erelong shall the snow‑white hand of God rend an opening through the darkness of this night and unlock a mighty portal unto His City. On that Day shall the people enter therein by troops, uttering what the blamers aforetime exclaimed, that there shall be made manifest in the end that which appeared in the beginning. The House of Justice assures you that your steadfastness, courage and perseverance are continually called to mind with love and appreciation. “These woes, afflictions, sufferings, imprisonment and toil are recorded in the divine court, and their recompense is abundant and irrevocable decreed. He, verily, rewardest without measure those who are patient”. [provisional translation] The divine blessings and spiritual forces released from the shedding of the pure blood of martyrs and the sacrifices and self‑effacements in enduring oppressive conditions on the part of the people of Bahá in that land have prepared and will continue to prepare the means for the fulfilment of the divine promises one after the other. In Bahá’u’lláh’s words, “. . . such adversity is the oil that feedeth the flame of this Lamp! Such is God’s transforming power. He changeth whatsoever He willeth; He verily hath power over all things.",
      "Shoghi Effendi, a few years after the start of his ministry, addressing the Central Spiritual Assembly of Írán, wrote the following:",
      "The release of this innocent and wronged community from the bonds of captivity, and its deliverance from the clutches of the enemy and oppressor, cannot but be accompanied by general commotions and disturbances; likewise the attainment by the people of Bahá to a position in which they will enjoy true honour, comfort and tranquillity must inevitably encounter the hostility and resistance, the clamorous opposition and tumultuous protests of all those who harbour enmity and rancour towards them. If, therefore, the troubled waters of the sea of adversity should grow yet more turbulent, if the storm of tribulation should increase in vehemence and assail that sore‑tried community from all six sides with fresh disasters, then know unhesitatingly and with unwavering conviction, that the hour of deliverance, the appointed time when the promises of old are to reach their glorious fulfilment, has drawn nigh, and that the means for the accomplishment of supreme and overwhelming victory by the hard‑pressed followers of the Greatest Name in that land have all been readied and prepared. Fixity of purpose and unfaltering resolution are the qualities that must needs be manifested by the people of Bahá if they are successfully to traverse these last remaining stages, and witness, at the highest levels, and in a manner that will fill them with astonishment, the realisation of their profoundest hopes and of their most deeply cherished desires. Such is the way of God—“and no change canst thou find in the way of God”.",
      "These sacred and powerful statements are, of course, the provisions of every faithful lover in the path of enduring difficulties and striving to attain the presence of the Well‑Beloved; however, it is often difficult to recognise in times of trial the signs of the victory of spiritual forces and the continuous consolidation of the foundation of the Cause of God. Study the message of the House of Justice dated 27 December 2005 addressed to the Counsellors gathered in the Holy Land and the Riḍván message of 2006 addressed to the Bahá’ís of the world, and notice to what extent the victories mentioned therein, each of which is considered a significant stride in establishing the foundation of the Cause of God, including the success of the community in developing the framework of action for the advancement of the process of entry by troops, have been attained after the revolution in Írán in 1357 and as a result of the divine blessings of your self‑sacrifices and self‑effacements.",
      "Consider the recent happenings in Egypt and how the steadfastness of the dear Bahá’ís in that land finally led to an unparalleled public proclamation of the Faith in the Arab world. In May 2006 alone, more than 20,000 people from Egypt visited the Arabic Bahá’í Web site to obtain information about the Faith and, in different parts of the world, those interested downloaded thousands of copies of Holy Writings in the Arabic language from the Bahá’í Reference Library. Millions of people became familiar with the Teachings and Principles of the Faith and the injustice of the enemies by watching a weekly programme on one of the well‑known television stations in that country. A group of intellectuals and human rights activists have publicly defended the right of the Bahá’ís to obtain identity cards, of which they are currently deprived. International Arabic newspapers around the world and different Internet sites in the Arabic language have given special consideration to the situation of the Bahá’ís in Egypt, which has led to giving publicity to the Faith and promoting the word of God.",
      "‘Abdu’l‑Bahá has stated the following in one of His Tablets: “And the amazing thing is this, that the most effective means whereby this light of truth is safeguarded and protected is the onslaught of the enemies, grievous ordeals and manifold hardships. The globe of this lamp is the tempestuous winds and the safety of this ship lieth in the violence of tumultuous waves.” Therefore, constant patience and the full preparation of the community to accept the increasing responsibilities resulting from the removal of obstacles and restrictions are required, so that at the appointed time and at the Will of the Blessed Beauty the doors of ease may be opened to the friends, the face of the Beloved may be seen and the day of victory appear.",
      "While reflecting and meditating on the situation existing in Írán and the difficulties facing the Bahá’í community, it is befitting for the dear believers, as they turn towards God, to keep in mind another important point: Because the enemies of the Faith in these days see themselves for various reasons restricted to increasingly and publicly assail the Bahá’í community, they do all in their power—from creating financial constraints to limiting social advancements, from creating fear and anxiety to spreading lies and calumnies, from forbidding Bahá’í students to enter university to making it easy to obtain passports and to leave the country—so as to encourage, or even force, the dear Bahá’ís to leave their homeland and thus to weaken and eventually eradicate, in their opinion, the Bahá’í community in Írán. In the light of the above points, it will become clear that leaving Írán under the present circumstances is a source of discouragement to those who are clinging to the cord of steadfastness and, no doubt, emboldens the enemies of the Faith and encourages them to pursue their inhumane goals in a more determined manner.",
      "One of the most valuable fruits of these sacrifices and of enduring the sorrows inflicted on you in the recent years is the notable increase in the receptivity of the peoples of the world and of Írán to accept the Faith. This precious asset, which is considered a foundation for new victories in the Formative Age and which has been obtained through the sacrifice of life, wealth, comfort and material and earthly advancements on the part of the dear believers, both young and old, should be utilised in the best possible manner. Your spiritual brothers and sisters around the world, with the support of the Bahá’í institutions, have focused their efforts on carrying out this task, and the Bahá’í community in Írán, whether individuals or Bahá’í institutions, should ever strive to ensure that they are intellectually and psychologically prepared and are equipped with Bahá’í knowledge and necessary skills to face this historic challenge. No doubt, you are aware of your duties in this critical moment regarding personal teaching which is the most important aspect of this preparation. Some time ago, after reviewing the situation in the Cradle of the Faith and the interests of the Cause in that country, the House of Justice advised the Friends in Írán to dissolve the training institute as a formal national system administered under their care, and from then onwards, they and the local Friends were not to be responsible for the matter of personal teaching on the part of the believers. This decision of the House of Justice was made as a matter of protection to the Friends in Írán, the local Friends and the Bahá’í community and in consideration of certain national issues, and as an expression of the desire of the Bahá’í community to collaborate with government officials. However, the implication of this decision is that individual believers should make added efforts in carrying out the important task of teaching, which is one of the spiritual and inviolable duties of every individual Bahá’í. They should not lose any opportunities, and by observing wisdom and through personal initiative, they should engage in this all‑important task, utilising to the extent possible the knowledge and spiritual insights gained in the institute process, and they should also assist and support each other in this path. Consider what ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá states regarding the importance of teaching,",
      "O ye servants of the Blessed Beauty! . . . It is clear that in this day, confirmations from the unseen world are encompassing all those who deliver the divine Message. Should the work of teaching lapse, these confirmations would be entirely cut off, since it is impossible for the loved ones of God to receive assistance unless they teach.",
      "Under all conditions, the teaching must be carried forward, but with wisdom. If the work cannot proceed openly, then let them teach in private, and thus engender spirituality and fellowship among the children of men . . .",
      "Therefore, O ye bearers of the trust of God, in these days when calamities, afflictions and woes have surrounded you on every side, raise your hands in gratitude to His Holy Threshold that, praised be God, you are considered among His faithful army, are clinging to the cord of His Covenant, are privileged to obey His Teachings, are robed in the garment of His steadfastness and are engaged in service and promoting the interests of the Cause. Share these points with your family members and your dear children and youth, and assure them of the deep appreciation of the House of Justice that thankfully their sacrifices too are inscribed in clear letters upon the divine Tablet and they are the source of pride to the Bahá’í community and to generations to come.",
      "The House of Justice gives assurance that it will offer prayers in the Holy Shrines for the sorely‑tested believers in Írán and will beseech their protection and success from the His Holy Threshold.",

      "One more year has passed since the imprisonment of a group of your fellow believers, devoted and loyal citizens of your nation, who, although themselves suffering from the deprivation of their basic human rights, had set themselves the task of assisting their community to arrange its affairs, educate its children, aid its youth debarred from university, take care of its elderly, and live according to its own spiritual precepts—thus to promote a distinguished pattern of life and help to build a dynamic society. For these “crimes” they have been confined to prison. The rest of the Bahá’ís in that land also suffer grievously from the arrows of religious fanaticism and ignorance for their unbending commitment to the high principles by which they have chosen to live their lives, and some of them, too, are incarcerated in several cities. Despite this oppression, which is so well known to every fair‑minded individual, those in authority brazenly deny the abuse of the basic rights of the Bahá’ís and peddle false accusations against you on the international stage and in the media. Yet with the growing awareness of the people of the world and of Iranians regarding the true intentions of the Bahá’ís, these denials and accusations are so widely recognised as untrue that those who utter them have, by their own actions, destroyed the credibility of all else they claim. As the poet states:",

      "A brief review of the past twelve months demonstrates a notable rise in the level of support for your rights. The calls raised in your defence by peoples and their governments in numerous countries over many years have elicited our warm appreciation. What is of special significance and deserves particular gratitude, however, is the chorus of brave voices that now, with mounting frequency, are raised by your own compatriots in difficult circumstances as they become increasingly aware of the magnitude of the injustice you suffer. Promoters of justice, artists, statesmen, thinkers, and other enlightened citizens of Írán—even prisoners of conscience from within their jail cells—are breaking their silence. This chorus for justice, which began first in the far‑flung regions of the world and gradually attracted to itself the voices of Iranians outside their homeland, is now rising to new and unprecedented levels inside Írán. Beyond recognition of the injustice meted out to you, the enlightened minds of your fellow citizens are more and more attentive to the principles you espouse and live by, and which are the means for the rehabilitation of every society. Principles such as the sanctity of human dignity; the oneness of humankind irrespective of tribe, race, or belief; the equality of men and women; freedom from prejudice; commitment to knowledge and learning; the abolition of extremes of wealth and poverty; the containment of greed; the harmony of faith and reason—these they increasingly recognise as essential for a progressive future.",
      "Beloved friends: This awakening, this rising consciousness in your land, should not be underestimated. You know well that, for every reported statement of support for you and for these principles, there are many who voice the same sentiments in private and who are now, in light of the current circumstances, learning how to express their views openly and to join the cohort of those who defend your rights and labour for peaceful coexistence.",
      "Consider how that spurious narrative, which the ailing minds of the prejudiced and the limited conceptions of the fanatics have concocted and for whose propagation they have, for 170 years, assiduously striven, has within just a few years become widely recognised to be utterly false. Not only that. This recognition has prompted your keenly alert compatriots to search for the motives for the unyielding insistence on purposely misrepresenting a spiritual movement that first rose up in Írán and today has won considerable acclaim the whole world over.",
      "How pleased we are to see that, through the audacious and selfless deeds of individuals who seek progress for their homeland, the culture of peaceful coexistence among peoples and religions characteristic of the bygone traditions of your venerable nation is undergoing a renaissance. Among the instances of such efforts within Írán, in connection with the situation of your community, these stand out as some of the most notable: the public defence of the rights of Bahá’ís by prominent personalities inside the country; outstanding and respected individuals prompting the general population to show sympathy towards the Bahá’ís for their suffering; the championing of the rights of the Bahá’ís by some of the distinguished and lion‑hearted women of that land; and the expressions of sympathy, both in public and private, on the part of certain senior Shí‘ah clerics. However, the open call for coexistence among the religions by one senior Íránian cleric was so dramatic, its implications so profound, and its reach so extensive that it has won the appreciation and support of religious figures, including Muslim leaders in other lands. Some have even voiced their optimism that such thoughtful actions may make it possible to raise collective awareness about the root causes of religious prejudice—a social malady which today blights the lives of countless millions throughout the world. Such spiritual leaders, detached from earthly matters, are extolled in the Bahá’í Writings as “the bearers of God’s mercy” and “the tokens of His favour”; all sincere and pure souls who arise in service to humankind and promote the cause of universal peace are described in the same Writings as those who “shall erelong shine like unto a brilliant star from the horizon of humankind and illuminate the whole earth”.",
      "Consider what is happening in the world. Darkness has so enveloped humankind—cruelty, oppression, prejudice—as to overwhelm the heart. But in every land, including your own, there are many individuals whose commitment to constructive principles, to love, to equity and fairness, and to a world‑embracing vision, is so strong that they are motivated to sacrifice worldly advantage for the betterment of others and for a future in which justice will reign. In so doing, such souls evoke the admiration of others as they slowly, perhaps imperceptibly, but with undeniable effect, enlighten minds and create the environment necessary for the realisation of unity in diversity. We thank God that you, followers of Bahá’u’lláh, are among those souls. You are enkindled with the light of faith, are committed to divine precepts, and, through lives devoted to Him Who is the Lifegiver of the world, are transforming human hearts. Keep, then, the flame of hope burning in your breasts and, with resolute commitment, continue in your path. Oppression and injustice, which prosper in the darkness of falsehood and deceit, abhor the light of truth and honesty, for the rays of that light will ultimately penetrate the veils of prejudice and illuminate the path of equality and justice.",
      "You have our heartfelt prayers, the abiding gratitude of your fellow believers, and the growing admiration of the peoples of the world.",

      "We convey to each and every one of you our undying love, our boundless admiration, and our affectionate greetings on the occasion of Naw‑Rúz and the start of the delightful season of spring. It is our hope that, despite countless hardships, you may find opportunities during this soul‑reviving time to spend some days in ease and comfort. Praised be God that you have received the bounty of true joy, a spiritual condition that belongs to those who, irrespective of their material and social circumstances, strive to draw ever nearer to God and to understand and promote His Word; who are concerned with the prosperity of all people; who tread selflessly the path of justice and equity; and who allow no impediment, not even oppression or imprisonment, to deprive them of this inner joy. It is this state of true joy that stirs the heart, makes the spirit soar, increases human powers, strengthens the mind, creates hope, and kindles the flame of longing to take purposeful action for the common good. So it is that, for Bahá’ís, bringing joy to the hearts is among the most praiseworthy of deeds. In the words of ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá, “As much as ye can, bring joy and happiness to the hearts and seek felicity for all humankind.”",
      "We hope that in the course of your traditional visits to one another in this blessed season you will, like the soul‑refreshing breeze, perfume the nostrils of your compatriots and sow the seeds of hope and assurance in the garden of the heart. Our Naw‑Rúz greetings and those of the followers of Bahá’u’lláh everywhere are extended to you and, through you, to the noble people of Írán, and we will remember you in the Holy Shrines, supplicating that divine bounties and blessings may surround you ever more abundantly.",

      "During the blessed days of Riḍván and in the company of a large contingent of the followers of the Blessed Beauty—pilgrims, visitors, and the friends serving at the Bahá’í World Centre—we circumambulated the Holy Shrines, expressing in our hearts profound gratitude for the unceasing divine confirmations that have led to significant advances for the Cause of God in nearly five thousand clusters across all continents, advances that have arisen out of the humble efforts of the friends, in collaboration with fair‑minded people of goodwill throughout the world, to work for the prosperity and betterment of society. In our prayers and meditations, we called you to mind and not only remembered the anniversaries of the arrests of the former Yárán and some of the distinguished friends who served the Bahá’í Institute for Higher Education, but also recalled, with heavy hearts, the persecution that thousands of Bahá’ís in Írán continue to face each day because of their religious beliefs and the more than one hundred believers that remain unjustly imprisoned. In our supplications at the Holy Threshold, we beseeched Him to bestow justice upon the rulers and fairness upon the clerics so that this oppression and tyranny might be brought to an end and that you and the other noble citizens of your ancient and sacred land may see the dawning light of peace and prosperity.",
      "What the events of the past year have demonstrated ever more clearly to the people of Írán and others from around the world who promote peace and concord is the stark contrast between the peaceful intentions and selfless service of the Bahá’í community and the lamentable and inhuman acts of those who, under the influence of ignorant religious prejudice, continue to perpetrate injustices against you. The support of Iranians of goodwill, whether living inside or outside Írán, offered in defence of the civil rights of their Bahá’í compatriots was also much in evidence. Whether it was students placing on an empty chair the name of a Bahá’í who had been barred from attending university; shop owners offering work to a Bahá’í, a fellow businessman whose trade permit had been revoked; or a number of friends and neighbours signing a petition consenting to the burial of a deceased Bahá’í whose interment had been prevented because of the alleged objections of the public—these are a few of the many examples that demonstrate the support, in cities and villages, of the generality of the people of Írán. There is also ample evidence to show that high‑minded Iranians from every segment of society—be they defenders of human rights; insightful and open‑minded clerics; political and social activists; writers, journalists, artists, producers of television programmes, and historians who, for the benefit of future generations, have endeavoured to collect documents and records related to the countless acts of oppression against the Bahá’ís and present an unbiased view of Bahá’í aims and beliefs in their work; those who in their articles and personal blogs express their sympathy and understanding; individuals who, by signing petitions, demand the restoration of your rights; or those who carry out extensive campaigns that protest against both the denial of higher education to Bahá’í youth and the general persecution of the Bahá’ís—share the conviction that all those living in that land, as concerned fellow citizens, can serve shoulder to shoulder to bring about progress in their beloved country. The support of humanitarian organisations, scientific institutions, Nobel Peace Prize Laureates, and representatives of various governments, as well as resolutions passed by the General Assembly of the United Nations, is evidence of how the people of the world abhor the ongoing persecutions that you and other Iranians endure.",
      "Your faith and certitude in the Manifestation of God for this resplendent age, your detachment from worldly affairs and attentiveness to spiritual life, your adherence to the principles of this great Faith, your iron will and legendary patience in enduring the difficulties you face in His path, the wisdom and constructive resilience you manifest in the face of the appalling conditions that currently beset you, and your determined endeavours in service to your beloved country and to the world—all these call to mind this passage revealed by the Supreme Pen where, after describing the zeal and overflowing love of His followers and recounting the sacrifices they make in fulfilment of the Divine Will, He states: “I swear by Thy glory, O my God! I am astonished at them and at that which they have manifested in the path of Thy love. Blessings and joy be upon them! . . . Methinks Thou didst fashion them for Thy love and didst single them out for attraction to Thee; Thou didst infuse into them the spirit of Thy Cause and didst reveal unto them the beauty of Thy oneness.” Rejoice, therefore, valiant knights in the arena of fidelity who tread the path of sacrifice, for you are the embodiments of this blessed statement of ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá: “O ye beloved of the Lord! Regard ye not the tyranny and iniquity of the ignorant. Resist oppression with justice, oppose tyranny with equity, and respond to bloodthirstiness with loving‑kindness. Be the well‑wishers of the advancement of Persia and its people and strive to promote civilisation for all humanity.”",

      "The growing evidences of the decline of the current world order, the rise of religious bigotry, and widespread confusion in efforts to resolve the many problems faced by humanity, on the one hand, and, on the other, the news of the momentous achievements of the followers of Bahá’u’lláh in collaboration with friends and other like‑minded people in their effort to create a unified society, calls to mind the beloved Guardian’s description of the two simultaneous processes of disintegration and integration. We hope that through your study of our messages of 29 December 2015, addressed to the Conference of the Continental Boards of Counsellors in the Holy Land, and of 2 January 2016, addressed to the Bahá’ís of the world, you have been able to envisage more clearly the progress of the Cause worldwide and to rejoice, alongside your spiritual sisters and brothers across the planet, in the successful conclusion of the current Five Year Plan and in the golden opportunities that will emerge over the next five years. On the first day of the conference, following the reading of the 29 December message and reflecting on the capacities of the community of the Greatest Name to achieve the goals of the new Plan, the Counsellors called to mind, with heartfelt expressions of awe and admiration, your constructive resilience and the countless sacrifices you have made in the path of the Beloved, singing beautiful anthems in your praise. During their visits to the Holy Shrines they offered supplications for the confirmations of the Concourse on high to descend unceasingly upon each and every one of you.",
      "Praise be to God that for over one hundred and seventy years the dearly loved believers in the Cradle of the Faith have contributed their considerable share to the progress of the Cause of God and to the advancement of divine civilisation. From the historic travels of the Letters of the Living and the sacrificial efforts of the early believers, to the formation of the first regular training classes in the Bahá’í world for youth; from spearheading the establishment of schools for girls and boys alike, to engaging in continuous efforts to disseminate knowledge and eliminate superstition; from endeavouring to eradicate all forms of prejudice, to cultivating fellowship and oneness; from promoting artistic endeavours, to initiating vast undertakings in the scientific, economic, social, and development fields; from conducting effective programmes for the spiritual education of children and the strengthening of families, to striving to bring about the full equality of women and men; from emphasising truthfulness and honesty as the foundation of all human virtues, to cultivating a vision of individual well‑being in the context of the common weal; from adhering to moral principles in all aspects of life, to promoting a culture of consultation and learning in an effort to build dynamic communities; from dispatching large numbers of homefront and international pioneers to the most remote parts of the world for the purpose of fostering unity and oneness, to pursuing personal spiritual obligations during these tumultuous days; from participating in useful discourses of society, to collaborating with fair‑minded citizens who are dedicated to serving their beloved homeland—all these endeavours attest incontrovertibly that the members of the community of the Greatest Name in that sacred land, with great sacrifice and under all conditions, have, from the inception of the Revelation to the present day, been at the forefront in tending the tree of the Cause of God and contributing to the establishment of a civilisation that is at once spiritually and materially prosperous.",
      "We remember all of you in our prayers and are assured that, inspired by the above‑mentioned messages and bearing in mind local conditions and the numerous challenges you face, you will, as ever, persevere in your fruitful endeavours wholly confident that the blessed day of unity and efficacious collaboration with your compatriots in building a flourishing society will assuredly come.",

      "O spiritual friends, this is the commencement of a delightful spring and a new season in the wondrous life of nature. It is a new stage in the spiritual springtime of the life of humanity. It is Naw‑Rúz, and the world of being has been renewed. It is the age of the descent of heavenly grace; a time for rejoicing and spreading abroad the divine melodies. We remember you in the Holy Shrines and convey our greetings to you and to all the noble and peace‑loving citizens of that sacred land on this joyous occasion.",
      "For centuries this ancient festival has been celebrated with jubilation. However, as ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá has said, every day spent in remembrance of God, in the promotion of fellowship, and in service to humankind is a blessed festival. We give thanks to God that your lives are wholly devoted to promoting unity and harmony and to attaining ever‑higher levels of collaboration in service to the common good. So it is that, for you, every day is potentially a feast, and thus you experience true and abiding joy. ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá says, “Strive with all your might and make the utmost endeavour for the prosperity of Persia and the advancement of its peoples.” In your pursuit of this injunction and despite the persecution you suffer, you continue to demonstrate to your fellow countrymen through your fidelity, love, honesty, and trustworthiness, that you are worthy companions as you tread with them the path of progress and advancement for Írán. Know the value of your station. Recognise, with humility, thankfulness, and gladness, that the growing interest of the general public in defence of your rights and the increase in the number of open‑minded Iranians who are eager to study and accept the teachings of God are among the blessings resulting from your constructive resilience and from your pure and holy deeds. Continue then upon this straight path. On this steep road, let your steed be patience and forbearance; your provision, divine guidance; your safeguard, heavenly confirmations; the goal of your journey, the fulfilment of God’s unfailing promises; and your reward, the joy you bring to the heart of your peerless Master and the eternal bliss you shall surely attain.",

      "Eight years have passed since the imprisonment of the former members of the ad hoc group known as the Yárán, and five years since the arrests of a number of Bahá’ís who assisted with the work of the Bahá’í Institute for Higher Education (BIHE). The arrests, the interrogations, and the imprisonments were in contravention not only of international standards, but also of the laws of the country. The result for the members of the Yárán was a verdict of twenty years’ imprisonment, which was subsequently reduced to ten years; although some of the BIHE workers have been freed, some remain imprisoned, notwithstanding that even a single day of any one of these incarcerations has been, and continues to be, evident injustice.",
      "Some imagined that this persecution would cause the believers to lose direction and hope, and that it would eventually cause the general weakening of the Bahá’í community. But you, the faithful followers of the Ancient Beauty, soon realised that the door to attending to your individual and collective affairs was open to you through consultation amongst families and in small groups. You, therefore, relying on the power of divine assistance, remained engaged in the field of service and managed your affairs, individuals with experience amongst you arose to assist others, and eager students and professors, with the full support of the community, continued their efforts to promote higher education; all in all, you did not allow the new challenges inflicted upon you to prevent you from pursuing your high aims and fulfilling your responsibilities as impelled by your conscience.",
      "You of course know well that the purpose of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation is to bring about a civilisation that is neither of the East nor of the West, a civilisation based on coherence between the material and the spiritual needs of humankind. You also know that recognising Him marks the commencement of a commitment to dedicate one’s personal and family life to contributing to the establishment of that civilisation. You are well aware that the fulfilment of this goal is facilitated through the activities and the maturation of the three protagonists in the advancement of civilisation: the individual, the community, and the institutions. Even as every living and active organism seeks to maintain its integrity and compensate for the loss of a part, when the darkness of injustice resulted in the closure of the Bahá’í administrative institutions in your land, you—both as a community and as individuals, the other two protagonists—sustained by the creative power of the Covenant, succeeded in compensating for this temporary loss.",
      "So it is that individuals, with a positive attitude and in a posture of learning, endeavour through their own initiative to fulfil personal spiritual obligations and to carry out acts of Bahá’í service while encouraging and supporting others to do the same. Such individuals strive to make the promotion of moral principles, the advancement of the spiritual education of children and junior youth, and the multiplication of other community‑building activities part of their daily lives. They seek to resolve various problems in their individual and collective lives through a process of consultation while maintaining unity at all times. Despite unjust restrictions, they work diligently to earn their livelihoods and are in the forefront of humanitarian pursuits in collaboration with their fellow citizens. They endure persecutions with constructive resilience, refute baseless accusations with wisdom and courage, and, in seeking to secure their rights through recourse to the legal channels open to them, have become a source of inspiration for other oppressed people. Notwithstanding the numerous injustices cruelly inflicted upon them, they refuse to entertain thoughts of revenge or violence and do not accept the label of victim. On the contrary, they persevere in the pursuit of their exalted aspirations with exemplary detachment, unwavering effort, iron determination, and resolute faith.",
      "The community, too, draws on everything within its power to augment its fruitful activities. As a dynamic and growing entity, it endeavours to create an environment in which the inner capacities of all of its members—whether new or veteran, men or women, young or old, urban or rural dwellers, and of whatever tribe or race throughout that land—flourish, and the ability to take counsel together, to make decisions, and to cooperate at the grassroots level is raised to new heights so that its members may serve more effectively towards the betterment of society. This community learns to read effectively the reality of its environment, to recognise existing opportunities, to utilise its resources, and to respond to present needs. It is committed to the promotion of an outward‑looking culture in which all are harmoniously engaged in strengthening their capacities to fulfil the exalted aims of the Faith such as the promotion of peace, the fostering of unity in diversity, the liberation of humanity from the yoke of oppression, the advancement of social justice, the furtherance of social and economic development activities, and the participation in meaningful discourses of society. It sees the youth as capable of service to humanity and supports them so that, by becoming the embodiments of pure deeds and goodly conduct, they may draw on the assistance of spiritual forces and, through systematic action, hasten to the field of service. Everyone in such a community, like the members of one body, moves forward together, striving to ensure that all have access to sufficient material means to enable them to manage their daily affairs and render befitting service to the Cause.",
      "Undoubtedly, the people of Bahá strongly believe in the eventual fulfilment of the aim of the Faith to ensure both the material and the spiritual prosperity of humanity. They are, however, also aware from their knowledge of divine exhortations that this is not an easy task and that the journey towards the attainment of this goal is a difficult one requiring years, nay centuries, of patience, constructive resilience, and a level of sacrifice that only the power of faith in the creative Word of God can instil in the human soul. The lovers of Bahá’u’lláh throughout the world are working sacrificially, each facing the specific challenges in his or her particular country in fulfilling the objectives of the new Five Year Plan. Joyful news of these individual and collective efforts reaches the Bahá’í World Centre daily.",
      "The share of the Bahá’ís of Írán in this process has from the inception of this Cause been a very special one. The history of the Cause in that land is brilliant. The Bahá’ís there, from the very beginnings of the Faith to this day, have sacrificed their lives, their wealth, their comfort, and their other worldly attachments. In the path of service to the Beloved, they have considered prison a palace, have accepted hardships as a bounty, and have responded to iniquity and oppression with patience and love. Though deprived of the freedom that their co‑religionists in other countries enjoy, they all, whether in prison or not, contribute generously to the fulfilment of the hopes of the Head of the Faith and the achievement of the goals of the Divine Plan.",
      "Beloved friends, we convey to you our heartfelt greetings and assure you of our prayers in the Holy Shrines on your behalf. As you observe the wondrous fruits of your many sacrifices, such as the ever‑growing eagerness of open‑minded Iranians to learn about and accept the divine teachings, as well as the spaces that have been opened to you to collaborate with your compatriots towards the advancement of your homeland, you undoubtedly also look with hope and confidence to the vast array of bright possibilities that lie ahead and, with gratitude for these blessings, offer your humble thanks unto Him.",

      "On the occasion of the advent of Naw‑Rúz and the arrival of soul‑stirring springtime, we convey our warm greetings to you, followers of the Abhá Beauty and loved ones of ‘Abdu’l‑Bahá. We hope that the revitalisation of nature, along with the joyful news you receive of the progress of the Cause, will cheer and refresh your hearts and spirits. Naw‑Rúz 2017 marks the beginning of the year of the two‑hundredth anniversary of the Birth of Bahá’u’lláh in the sacred city of Ṭihrán, a year during which Bahá’ís throughout the world, together with other champions of peace and brotherhood, will honour the greatness of His Mission to establish the unity of humankind. A great multitude in cities and villages, and many artists, writers, poets, leaders, educators and other prominent thinkers in every corner of the world, each according to his or her own initiative and inspiration, will mark that turning point in history. They will pay homage to the marvellous gift of His Revelation—which includes a new conception of religion, as well as a clear vision of the oneness of humanity and the guidance necessary for its realisation. How befitting it is that many of the fair‑minded and receptive citizens of Írán now take pride in the fact that this Personage is a Son of that sanctified soil and as a result of this blessed association, Írán is considered a sacred land and Naw‑Rúz is celebrated every year throughout the world. Our thoughts and ardent prayers are constantly with you. Praise be to God that, through the confirmations of the Concourse on High, you have demonstrated to the people of Írán and of the world that, despite ongoing persecution by unjust and prejudiced elements, you continue, with wisdom, courage and meekness, to endeavour in the path of love for humanity, spreading the sweet savours of unity, and you hold no bitterness or resentment towards any individual, rank or authority.",

      "As the ninth year of the imprisonment of the former members of the Yarán draws to an end, they continue to be deprived of their basic human rights. Vast numbers of people in Írán and throughout the world look forward to the conclusion of this prolonged and illegal confinement. Although some of those who were imprisoned for serving the Bahá’í Institute for Higher Education have been released after completing years of unjust sentences, others remain in prison. And still others continue to be jailed for various contrived reasons. Promoters of education and learning, who view the establishment and continuous functioning of the Institute as one of the most brilliant examples of constructive resilience, demand an end to the deprivation from access to education suffered by the Bahá’í youth of Írán.",
      "In reality all of you, whether veteran Bahá’ís or new believers, are subject in some way to injustice and cruelty, to oppression and tyranny, at the hands of the ignorant and the prejudiced. The policy of economic strangulation directed against you is executed under various pretexts. The humiliation of Bahá’í schoolchildren and expulsion of university students continues unabated. The malicious attacks upon Bahá’í homes, followed by the confiscation of property, the arrests of individuals, the demands for heavy bail, and the issuing of baseless verdicts in the courts, are unceasing. At the same time extensive negative propaganda, spread through officially controlled media and defamatory films designed to inflame the public mind against a portion of the citizens of the country, is constantly increasing. This prejudice and inequity towards law‑abiding citizens is routinely perpetrated by some of the officials who claim to be proponents of Islámic justice.",
      "The specious character of the oppressors’ claims is now clear and evident to all. Some of the events of the past year have left no doubt in the minds of the people of Írán and beyond, that the rigid fanaticism and worldly considerations of some among the religious leaders are the real motive for all the opposition and oppression against the Bahá’ís. The representatives of the country on the international stage are no longer able to deny that these acts of discrimination are in response to matters of belief and conscience. Officials, lacking any convincing explanation for their irrational conduct and unconcerned at the damage done by their narrow policies to the name and credibility of the country, find themselves unable even to give a plausible answer to why they are so apprehensive about the existence of a dynamic Bahá’í community in that land.",
      "The wide‑ranging activities of large numbers of people in thousands of localities throughout the world over the next few months will be a demonstration of joy and devotion in recognition of the two hundredth anniversary of the Birth of Bahá’u’lláh. It will also be a reflection of hope and confidence in the process of building vibrant communities in His Name. Your compatriots, upon hearing this news, will come to learn that although the Bahá’ís in the land of the birth of this Faith are subjected to such intense prejudice, the Bahá’í vision and principles are greatly admired and appreciated throughout the rest of the world. One example of this appreciation is the recent message from the President of one of the most populous countries of the world who, at the start of the bicentenary year, has publicly invited the citizens of his country to reflect on the life of Bahá’u’lláh and on His unifying teachings. The esteem of the peoples of the world for the goals and teachings of this world‑embracing spiritual movement that arose from Írán is, no doubt, a source of pride for all pure‑hearted Iranians.",
      "Beloved friends: those intoxicated by the ephemeral power of this world and unaware of the spiritual potency of the dawntide supplications of the oppressed and of the heartbreaking sighs of the wronged have vainly imagined that they will ultimately succeed in crushing the community of the Most Great Name in that land. Yet, observe how in the past few decades, and particularly in the last ten years, the awakening of the people of Írán to the reality of the Bahá’í community in their midst and the situation that confronts it, their sympathy for the injustices you have experienced, and their solidarity with you in building a diverse and united society have created precious opportunities for collaboration. With faith, then, in the divinely ordained decrees and confidence in the compelling power of the Will of God, and with inspiration from the Bahá’í Writings, sustain your efforts in the promotion of fellowship and brotherhood which are the true foundations for the progress and glory of Írán and be assured of the continuous outpouring of divine confirmations and the coming of the blessed day of freedom and tranquillity.",

      "We extend to you our heartfelt greetings on the joyous occasion of Naw‑Rúz and the arrival of spring. Most assuredly, you have partaken abundantly of the spiritual bounties of the blessed days of the Fast and are now celebrating the new year with your families, friends, and neighbours. Yours is the honour of living in a country about which the beloved Guardian stated: “The people of Bahá, whether inside or outside Írán, venerate the birthplace of the Blessed Beauty and sacrifice their own interests and comfort, nay their very lives and substance, for the revival, glory, progress, and furtherance of the true welfare of that land.” This is why striving for the advancement of that revered country is particularly dear to you and to Bahá’ís the world over, and why—with complete confidence in the great and glorious future of Írán—you are ever ready to render sincere and valuable services in this path, labouring shoulder‑to‑shoulder with your well‑intentioned and eager compatriots.",
      "Dearly loved friends! The Bahá’í world is still astir with the blessings of the bicentenary celebrations of the Birth of Bahá’u’lláh. News of the progress of the spiritual enterprise of building dynamic and vibrant communities in collaboration with others continues to flow to the Holy Land from five continents. Praised be God that, despite unrelenting persecutions, you too are contributing your valued share to the fulfilment of the lofty aims of the Ancient Beauty and the spiritual goals of this Most Great Cause. Your purpose in life is to draw ever closer to God, and your thoughts are centred upon advancing the common weal. You observe the chaos and the turbulence of the world and see in them the dawn of the unfoldment of a new Order in human society. You give thanks to the Sacred Threshold for having been honoured with the bounty of service, and your joy is redoubled at the knowledge that this Day shall not be followed by night and this light shall never be extinguished. During these joyful days, consort with your fellow citizens and inspire hope in the hearts of the despondent. For our part, conscious of the impact of the spiritual forces released through your consecrated acts of sacrifice for the advancement of the Cause, we raise our hands in gratitude and offer prayers in the Holy Shrines for you and all the noble people of Írán.",

      "The magnificent gathering in the Holy Land of delegates from 166 countries, for the purpose of participating in the Twelfth International Bahá’í Convention and electing the members of the Universal House of Justice, was concluded with the celebration of the Twelfth Day of the Festival of Riḍván in the precincts of Bahá’u’lláh’s exalted Shrine. More than fifteen hundred delegates participated in the election. Among the distinct features of this Convention, which not only added to its beauty and charm but also generated an ineffable degree of joy and enthusiasm among all participants, were the presence of a record number of National Spiritual Assemblies and delegates and the participation of some National Assemblies for the first time, including one of the oldest Assemblies in the Bahá’í world. At the opening session of the Convention, in language brimming with affection and love, the Chairperson acknowledged the absence of the representatives of the sorely tested friends in the Cradle of the Faith and, having expressed the gratitude of Bahá’ís throughout the globe for your sacrifices, which for many years have been a source of inspiration for the followers of the Blessed Beauty throughout the planet, recalled the vital contributions you have made to the advancement of the Cause of God. During another session, in the name of the patient believers in Írán, representatives of the nations of the Pacific region, joined by all those present, chanted in stirring tones these blessed words of Bahá’u’lláh: “Should they attempt to conceal His light on the continent, He will assuredly rear His head in the midmost heart of the ocean and, raising His voice, proclaim: ‘I am the lifegiver of the world!’” They thus reinforced the bonds of affection and solidarity between the friends assembled at the Convention and the believers in Írán. The spiritual and jubilant atmosphere, the richness of experiences, and the palpable unity of thought that characterised the consultations were signs of the growing capacity of Bahá’í communities throughout the world to contribute to the establishment of the civilisation envisioned by Bahá’u’lláh. The beauty and grandeur of the concept of unity in diversity illumined the eyes and captured the hearts. The opening verses of a poem by Varqá, the martyr, chanted during the commemoration of the Ninth Day of Riḍván held in the Ḥaram‑i‑Aqdas, were expressive of the feeling shared by all participants:",

      "The reason that the Bahá’ís of Írán were deprived from participating in this spiritual Convention is well known to the people of the world. The dissemination of bigotry, calumny, and mistrust by certain authorities as a means of advancing their own malicious designs has entangled the people of Írán, you among them, in countless problems. Even though six of the seven former members of the Yárán, after enduring ten years of cruel imprisonment, have, with heads held high, returned to their families and to the constructive environment of the Bahá’í community, and have rejoined their loyal fellow citizens who have set their hopes on the future glory of Írán, yet the continued tyrannical incarceration of other wronged believers is a clear indication of an ongoing animosity that is both one‑sided and unfounded. These friends, purely because of their spiritual beliefs, languish behind the bars of enmity and hatred. Of course, all Bahá’ís in Írán, young and old, schoolchildren and students, athletes and artists, manufacturers and farmers, shopkeepers and labourers, have always been and are still affected by various forms of oppression and injustice. However, praised be God that you are adorned with the mantle of faith and firmness in the Covenant; possess a broad vision, according to which service to one’s country and fellow beings is the source of true happiness and eternal progress; and are well aware that the spiritual transformation of the world and the spiritual growth of humanity require time and self‑sacrifice. Render thanks then to God that, as clearly demonstrated in the documentary film, A Widening Embrace, the fruit of the seed of your faithfulness is now apparent in every region of the world.",

      "Springtime is here once again and the cycle of nature has taken another turn.  It is a new and wondrous season, whose essential qualities are the bright light of the sun and vernal showers and breezes, which enable the capacity latent in the earth to be released, the flowers to bloom, the birds to warble, the desert to become verdant, and a fresh spirit to be breathed into the contingent world.  This physical spring is reminiscent of the Mystic Spring that arrived once more with the rising of the Sun of Truth above the horizon of the sacred land of Írán, shedding illumination upon east and west.  The showers of mercy rained down, the heavenly breezes wafted, the hyacinths of inner meaning sprang forth, and the world of humanity was given life anew and freshness beyond measure.  Although this spiritual Springtide is still in the early stages of its effulgence, yet the initial signs of the influence, transformative power, and unifying force of the divine civilisation that has been renewed in this wondrous cycle can already be glimpsed throughout the world, especially in those places where the spiritual enterprise has advanced in degrees of progress.",
      "The year ahead of us is most auspicious and blessed, for it coincides with the Bicentenary of the Birth of that distinguished Son of Írán, the Primal Point, the Most Exalted Countenance, the Herald and Harbinger of this spiritual Springtime.  This occasion is a time of celebration for everyone throughout the world, but Iranians, who are honoured by being compatriots of the Twin Manifestations in this luminous age, have a special share in these festivities.  We greet each and every one of you and the other noble citizens of Írán, wish you joy on the occasion of Naw‑Rúz, and offer heartfelt prayers in the Holy Shrines for your increasing success in the path of service to your country and countrymen and for the opening of the gate of justice and equity in that land.",
